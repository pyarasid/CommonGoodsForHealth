"PROMOTING LUNG HEALTH IN TAJIKISTAN II PHASE. 1. The tuberculosis (TB) situation in Tajikistan is severe. The TB incidence is nearly 190 new cases per 100 000 inhabitants (Finland: 5-6/100 000 per year). Resitance to TB drugs is a common and an increasing problem. Patients with respiratory symptoms are very frequent in the primary health care. The diagnosis and care of these patients is difficult without adequate equipment. WHO has developed the Practical Approach to Lung Health (PAL) Strategy to support and develop the abilities of the primary health care to diagnose and treat tuberculosis and other respiratory conditions at the primary health care level. In 2012 a small scale PAL training project was initiated in Tajikistan.2. The main objective of the continuation project is to improve health of the Tajik people by decreasing the morbidity and mortality of respiratory disease and tuberculosis by means of the PAL strategy. The project supports the ongoing reforms of the national health care system in Tajikistan.3.The project emphasizes primary health care and prevention with special support to the development of organizational and educational aspects of respiratory disease. Finnish health care programs and best care practices of respiratory medicine are used as models - if applicable.4. The target of the continuation project is the health of the population of Tajikistan. Patients with TB and other respiratory conditions and their relatives as well as the health care personnell are targeted.5. - The main activity is training of PAL trainers. In the training TB and TB drug resitance are emphasized including TB risk factors ( HIV tobacco diabetes social determinants TB infection control).- the Filha experience of a community based tobacco project in Kyrgyzstan has been encouraging and it will be used in the work against tobacco in Tajikistan.- the Finnish National Allergy Program offers a new approach to prevent allergy and asthma. The basis will be introduced in Tajikistan.- the PAL strategy will be revised in the WHO Euro region. Filha will use the experiences of Central Asian PAL countries in this regard.- the cooperation between the respiratory disease and TB physicians in Central Asia will be supported. - Filha will assist in the evaluation and development of distance education in Tajikistan.- the registration and statistics of respiratory disease and smoking will be improved together with the USAID.","Control_Cross_Border_Disease"

"IMAGE ANALYSIS FOR RELIABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE CANCER DETECTION. A crucial aspect for reliable automated analysis of cell samples for cancer detection is accurate and robust quantification of very subtle changes in the nuclear chromatin distribution through image analysis. This requires high resolution, perfect focus for each cell nucleus and robustness against staining variations. This is very hard and expensive to achieve with conventional optics.Recently (2013) a new way of creating images in a light microscope was invented, Fourier ptychographic microscopy, FPM. This technique holds promise to address all three of the crucial problems in chromatin distribution quantification. However, the technique needs improvements in terms of computational efficiency and it needs to be adapted and optimized for the needs of cancer detection. We plan to do that within this project.We have since 2008 had a collaboration between India and Uppsala University on developing a new cost effective system for cervical cancer screening. The FPM technique holds promise for increasing the performance of the developed system. We also propose to use the same technique for addressing two other common and increasing cancers: oral cancer and thyroid cancer. The Indian project partners have a strong background in cancer research, the Swedish team combines long-standing expertise in the field of digital cytometry with expertise in robust and precise image analysis.","Knowledge_Gen_Sharing"
"SLAMF6 AND 2B4: ROLES AND MODES OF ACTION IN NORMAL IMMUNITY AND CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY. A functioning immune system is critical for successful treatment of cancer. Recent studies have shown an improvement of the immune response against cancer triggered by new drugs that block the function of certain types of receptors at the surface of immune cells. This project seeks to understand the role of two new potential molecular targets for immunotherapy against cancer in humans: the SLAMF6 receptor and the 2B4 receptor. These receptors are at the surface of key immune cells (CD8+T and NK lymphocytes), and they play an important regulatory role during the anti-tumor response mediated by these cells. The research team hypothesizes that pharmacological targeting of SLAMF6 and 2B4 could be helpful in the treatment of cancer. Findings from this research project will further basic knowledge of the role of SLAMF6 and 2B4 in immune cells, and determine whether these two receptors are valid clinical targets for pharmacologic treatment of human cancers.  The project is led in Canada by the Institut de recherches cliniques de MontrTal (affiliated with the University of Montreal), in collaboration with the Hadassah Hebrew University (Israel), Universidad Aut=noma del Estado de Morelos (Mexico), and the Hebrew University (Israel). This project was selected and approved for funding through the second research competition of the Joint Canada-Israel Health Research Program, which is a partnership between Canada's International Development Research Centre, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, the Israel Science Foundation and the Azrieli Foundation. This 7-year, $35M Canadian-Israeli effort draws on the unique scientific strengths of both countries and facilitates networking opportunities with peers from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Projects include a plan for integrating researchers from low- and middle-income countries that will establish long-term scientific relationships.","Knowledge_Gen_Sharing"

"COMBATTING ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE BY NOVEL ANTIMALARIAL MOLECULES AGAINST PLASMODIUM VIVAX AND P. FALCIPARUM FROM SOUTH AMERICA AND SOUTH-EAST ASIA. A large and growing number of the world's population live in slums, where the twin trajectories of rapid urbanisation andincreased flooding driven by climate change collide. Top-down policies designed to reduce flood risk in informalsettlements have to date been largely unsuccessful, yet many of the vulnerabilities faced by slum-dwellers cannot beaddressed by local action alone. Many observers posit that a fundamentally important part of the solution is to integrategovernment and community resilience initiatives, an approach we call Community-Responsive Adaptation. However,real-world examples of this type of integration are scarce, and have not been systematically evaluated, either in terms ofcost, or impact. In this study, we partner with an award-winning non-governmental organization, Kounkuey DesignInitiative, and with slum residents and local government, to co-design, build and evaluate three integrated adaptationprojects in Kibera, Nairobi. To evaluate the effects of the projects, we will carry out a 6-wave household survey across1500 households in high flood-risk zones, and compare flood damages and other measures of welfare in households withthe same baseline flood risk in treatment sites, and at comparable control sites. Finally, we will collect and analyzequalitative data to help understand the mechanisms behind success or failure of the package of interventions.","AMR_Response"

"GLOBAL SURGERY - GROIN HERNIA, MOSQUITO MESH AND TASK SHARING. A major objective with this project is to University of Leon, Nicaragua, transfer technology for diagnosis of Zika and Chikungunya viruses, two mosquito-borne viruses that in recent years have spread explosively in Latin America and which WHO classified as a global threat against humanity. Establishment and quality assured diagnostics of for example Zika virus in endemic regions is of particularly high priority, which WHO has pointed out several times. A second objective is to identify host genetic factors associated with clinical severity to these pathogens. Our hypothesis is that the large clinical variation of symptoms, from asymptomatic to severe illness following Zika and Chikungunya virus infections, partly depends on host genetic factors. In this project we will collect clinical records, serum and saliva samples (n=400) from individuals infected with Zika/Chikungunya viruses with different degrees of illness and at the same time collect samples from individuals who live in the same environment but do not become sick. We intend to study whether mutations in the histo-blood groups antigens, DC-SIGN, TLR3, Fc?II (CD32), Viperin, CCR5 (CCR5?32) and IFNa and IFN ? contributes to morbidity. Through lectures, workshops and seminars, we will work towards establishing high quality diagnostics to enable rapid diagnosis and to identify risk factors in the population.","Epidemic_Pandemic_Prep"

We will focus on a subset of antigens (n=10) that have been shown to be potential targets of protective immunity and include both conserved and polymorphic proteins. We will sequence the parasites collected from the community to define precisely the diversity at the selected loci, express these antigens and then analyse the antibody responses to conserved and diverse antigens. We will specifically investigate combinations of antigens and variants of antigens to which antibodies confer protection. The project will use samples that are and have been collected within longitudinal well-established cohorts in Ghana and Kenya, as well as Swedish travelers. The proposed collaboration includes workshops and involves several PhD students including a joint PhD supervision between Ghana, Kenya and Sweden, and will be mutually beneficially for the research development of all partners.","not_global_func"

"NIGERIA UNHAS: ACCESS TO NORTH-EAST THROUGH PROVISION OF HUMANITARIAN FLIGHTS. Access to north-east Nigeria remains very difficult and dangerous since bombings, attacks and counter-insurgency activities are happening on a regular basis. UN agencies and humanitarian organizations at large have increased their response in and around the states' capitals and need to benefit from safe and reliable flights to access their operational areas. Supporting UNHAS will ensure humanitarian access to north-east Nigeria through the provision of safe and reliable air transport services as well as to provide capacity for evacuation of humanitarian staff when required.","not_global_func"
"ENHANCING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS SUPPORT FOR MATERNAL, ADOLESCENT AND NEWBORN HEALTH PROJECT PLUS CONTRACEPTION IN RURAL TANZANIA (IMCHA). Access to the means of preventing unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions is critical for averting maternal and newborn deaths and disease. One out of every five Tanzanians is an adolescent, and by the age of 19, half of all girls are pregnant or have already given birth to a child. While contraceptive use by adolescents has increased, less than one in every six adolescents uses contraceptive methods. There are severe limitations in access to family planning services in rural Tanzania, particularly in the districts surrounding Lake Victoria.   This project, a collaboration between the BruyFre Research Institute and Shirati KMT Council Designated Hospital, will complement a current project to build an enhanced cadre of community health workers in rural Tanzania by integrating a focus on the reproductive health needs of women. The project will train community health workers (CHWs) to educate adolescents and women about family planning options, including safe sexual behaviors, and help improve access to family planning services using mobile health applications. Nurses will be trained to work with these CHWs to provide enhanced family planning methods and prevent stock shortages by using m-health stock monitoring of family planning items.A mixed methods approach will be used to measure the effectiveness and impact of the interventions under this project. Quantitative measurements of contraceptive use (from baseline and post-intervention) will be undertaken using m-health measures of stock levels and work flows of CHWs. Qualitative data from focus group discussions with women, CHWs, and nurses, as well as participatory research activities with policymakers, will ensure a better understanding of the cultural aspects of reproductive health and needs from women and adolescents. Involvement of regional and district medical officers in planning and regular engagement of policymakers at local, regional, and national levels will increase awareness and integration of knowledge in policy and programming.This project is funded by the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa program. It is a seven-year $36 million initiative funded by Global Affairs Canada, IDRC, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.","not_global_func"

"ACTIVE YOUTH IN THE PEACE BUILDING PROCESS IN COLOMBIA. After more than half a century of conflict, the signature of a definitive ceasefire agreement between the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) signals a historic movement towards peace. Colombia's youth have suffered tremendously from the ongoing conflict. More than half of the war's eight million registered victims were younger than 28 years old. In Colombia in general, of the 13 million young people, 4.5 million are neither working nor studying. Young people represent more than half of the total of registered unemployed, and most young people who are working hold precarious jobs. This project will support economic opportunities for vulnerable Colombian youth in conflict-affected territories by piloting approaches for financial inclusion and career training. Through this project, Fundaci=n Capital - FundaK, a Colombian non-governmental organization working to develop new approaches to poverty reduction through public and private partnerships, will develop, test, and assess a scalable strategy that targets the specific needs of youth in post-conflict regions in Colombia. The aim will be to promote employability and economic opportunities for them. The project will foster financial literacy and inclusion, provide young people with professional orientation, life planning, and coaching, and use digital solutions to foster learning and allow for cost-effective expansion. This pilot will target 1,200 youth. If results are successful, the approach will be scaled up to reach a larger number of young people. It will help ensure that this generation of young people can find a future in Colombian society and contribute to the peace process.","not_global_func"

"RICE, MALNUTRITION AND MULTIPLE METALS û REASONS FOR IMPAIRED CHILD GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT?. Against the background of the recent reports of alarming concentrations of toxic metals like arsenic and cadmium in rice-based baby food, the overall aim of this application is to assess the influence of early-life exposure to rice-based metals on children's growth and cognitive and behavioral development. Also high concentrations of manganese, an essential element which is shown to be neurotoxic at higher doses, have been detected in infant food. Specifically, we will i) estimate the exposure to the toxic metals through rice; ii) evaluate different biomarkers of manganese exposure; iii) evaluate associations of exposure biomarkers (in children with low arsenic and manganese in drinking water) with available data on child growth and development, including effects of combined exposure; and iv) assess the interactions with known susceptibility factors, such as nutrition, gender, and genetic predisposition. The studies will be based on our ongoing large and well-characterized mother-child cohort (n=1500) in a poor area in rural Bangladesh. Because rice is the main staple food and the nutritional status varies markedly, this cohort provides unique possibilities to evaluate potential health effects of the toxic metals in rice on children and important susceptibility factors. In this cohort, we have assessed child anthropometry and development (cognitive performance and behavior) at 1.5, 5 and 10 years of age in relation to elevated metals exposure through drinking water. The total exposure to arsenic, cadmium and manganese is based on available concentrations in biomarkers, such as concentrations in urine and blood, measured in the mothers during pregnancy and in the children at the different follow-ups. We also have detailed information on the concentrations in the drinking water used over time. In a sub-sample, we have also measured metals and other trace elements in rice (various types and degree of polishing). The exposure to the metals through rice will be evaluated based on the i) estimated intake through rice, ii) the biomarker concentrations in the children with low concentrations in the drinking water and iii) the intercept of the biomarker concentrations regressed against the drinking water concentrations. As there is no known biomarker for manganese exposure, we will, in a sub-sample evaluate the relationship between various biomarkers (urine, blood, plasma, and hair), analyzed by modern ICP-MS in clean-room facilities, and also with the concentrations in water. All biomarker concentrations will also be compared with those in rice, measured in a sub-sample of the cohort. Evaluations will be gender-specific and consider nutritional status (anthropometry, SES and biomarker concentrations of selenium, zinc, and iodine), known to affect both absorption and toxicity.

"PERSONALISING ANTI MALARIA THERAPY THROUGH HAND-HELD POINT OF CARE NANOTECHNOLOGY DEVICES.. Aim: to test the first point of care application of drug resistance molecular markers for optimal antimalarial treatment, through a novel nanotechnology-based device with the potential of allowing optimal, personalized, malaria chemotherapy. Three studies: 1- lab fine tuning of the hand-held device for point of care parasite analysis in terms of specificity and sensitivity for genetic polymorphism call, vs established methods; information feedback to the technology developers for machine optimization. The device will fastly genotype the parasite prior to treatment, giving information for optimal ACT choices. 2- The field (Mali): an artemether-lumefantrine (AL) vs artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) efficacy trial will be conducted in high transmission regions of Mali. The pfmdr1 N86Y mutation will be used as the reference (86N allele: resistance to AL; 86Y allele: resistance to ASAQ). In one arm the infection is genotyped. If 86Y, it is treated with AL, if 86N, with ASAQ. In another arm AL and ASAQ are used randomly without support information, in accordance to the national guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. An increased in efficacy, as well as decreased selection of resistance associated alleles is expected at arm1. 3- Finally, the output of the trial will be re-analysed with reference methods (PCR-RFLP, direct PCR amplicon sequencing) for the post-hoc evaluation of the specificity and sensitivity of the device in the field conditions","AMR_Response"

"THE ROLE OF DIABETES-ASSOCIATED PATHOLOGY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLINICAL TUBERCULOSIS: A COLLABORATIVE PROJECT BETWEEN SWEDEN AND BANGLADESH. An important but currently neglected threat for the development of active tuberculosis (TB) is diabetes, which increase the risk of clinical TB several fold. In this proposal, we take advantage of a well-established collaboration with Bangladesh to explore the role of diabetes in the pathogenesis and progression of chronic TB disease. We will use patients samples collected in well-designed clinical studies and advanced immunological techniques to carefully characterize macrophage function as well as the behaviour and relevance of peripheral lymphocyte responses involved in TB and how these are affected by concomitant diabetes disease. Our research constellation has also developed novel concepts for immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy of TB that will be evaluated in patients with diabetes. Here, a novel B cell test will be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of active TB in patient cohorts recruited in a high-prevalence setting in Dhaka, Bangladesh. In a clinical trial, we will also study if novel inducers of antimicrobial peptides, phenylbutyrate and vitamin D, can restore immune function and insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients with TB. Our ambition is to promote knowledge and technology transfer between the collaborating institutions, partly by local PhD and postdoc training, to gain synergistic effects on the discovery of clinically relevant targets that could be used to improve medical management and general health of patients with TB and diabetes.","Knowledge_Gen_Sharing"

"REDUCING SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION IN ARGENTINA. Argentina is one of the world's highest consumers of sugar-sweetened beverages (predominantly sodas). This project will address the problem, and the rapidly increasing rates of obesity and diabetes among youth and adults, through evidence that supports policy development. Improved policies, better health Argentina has begun to implement important policies to reduce the country's non-communicable disease burden, including policies for tobacco control and reduced salt and trans-fatty acids. There is now a growing regional public health interest in regulating sugar-sweetened beverages to prevent disease. As awareness of the health impacts of soda consumption grows, government and civil society stakeholders are interested in policy options to decrease consumption. Taxing soda consumption This project aims to generate evidence to inform this policy development. It will: -describe the market process from production to distribution and consumption -explore the regulatory and legal framework -examine feasibility challenges and the potential impact of tax increases on soda consumption -explore mechanisms that will enable these taxes to increase Researchers will assess the magnitude of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with consuming sugar-sweetened drinks. They will model the health and health-cost benefits of reduced soda intake associated with price increases over the next decade. The predicted global increase of non-communicable diseases will disproportionally affect women and poor people, so the project's methods will analyze policy impacts by gender and socio-economic status. The research team is composed of public health experts, physicians, lawyers, sociologists, and economists. It also includes high-level staff from the Ministry of Health. The project team will share the results through scientific papers in open access journals, policy briefs, and media releases.","not_global_func"

"EMPOWERING HEALTH CARE DECISION-MAKERS TO ACHIEVE REGIONAL NEEDS FOR TOBACCO CONTROL IN LATIN AMERICA. As the burden of chronic diseases continues to grow in Latin America, it is a critical time to advance tobacco control policies. This project will analyze the cost-effectiveness of tobacco control policies and recommend interventions to policymakers. Little progress, pressing need Despite considerable international evidence, several key factors continue to delay the implementation of important measures in the region: misinformation, prejudice, lack of country-level comprehensive data, and pressure from interest groups. This project builds on earlier work on the development and validation of an economic model to estimate the social, economic, and health burden of tobacco, together with the expected impact of tax increases in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru. Researchers will develop and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of packages of interventions for tobacco control for these countries. They will also conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of fiscal policies for tobacco in five other countries: Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, and Uruguay. Impact of tobacco tax increases The first part of the project will -quantify the disease burden associated with smoking, including its effects on health (years of life lost, quality adjusted life years, disease events) and its economic impact (costs of illness) -quantify the revenue currently obtained from tobacco taxation and compare it with the economic burden of tobacco-related diseases -analyze the impact of raising taxes on cigarettes on government revenues and on smoking prevalence under a wide range of scenarios -quantify the effects of the estimated reductions in smoking prevalence due to tax increases in terms of population health benefits and economic impact -estimate the cost-effectiveness of different tax increase scenarios in each of the participating countries -integrate the data for these five countries with the data generated for the other seven countries: Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru Evidence packages and cost-effectiveness evaluations The second part of the project will -identify top-priority tobacco control interventions -determine decision-makers' information needs -generate evidence packages with four to six prioritized interventions -generate two to three cost-effectiveness studies for participating countries","Response_Unhealthy_Products"

This project will offer new insights into the informal food sector, and identify entrepreneurship and job opportunities for women and youth.Growth in urban populations The urban population in developing countries is expected to exceed 50% for the first time by 2020. Over the next 30 years, these cities will absorb 95% of urban growth. By 2030, they will be home to almost 4 billion people, or 80% of the world's urban population. As people move to the cities, there is a growing crisis of food insecurity. Food prices are high and incomes are low. Even in countries experiencing rapid economic growth, food insecurity is a major challenge. Within this context, the urban food economy is an important laboratory for examining whether and how inclusive growth strategies can have a positive impact by encouraging entrepreneurship, raising incomes, alleviating poverty, and mitigating the crisis of food insecurity.The Hungry Cities InitiativeThe goal of the Hungry Cities Initiative is to promote inclusive growth in the informal food sector through research on policy approaches that enable it, combined with measures that support entrepreneurship and decent employment. The Hungry Cities Initiative seeks to provide a global perspective on the links between three major transformation processes: rapid urbanization, the crisis of food insecurity, and the informal economy's emergence as the major source of livelihood for urban poor, including women and youth.The African Centre for Cities at the University of Cape Town (South Africa) and the Balsillie School of International Affairs at Wilfrid Laurier University (Canada) run the Hungry Cities Initiative.

"PAPER MICROARRAYS AS COMPREHENSIVE LOW-COST POINT OF CARE DIAGNOSTICS OF PAEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN UGANDA (PI-POC). BACKGROUNDInfectious diseases are the leading cause of illness in children. When managing bacterial infections it is important and often crucial that antibiotics are given without delay, however the spread of antibiotic resistance due to over-prescription of antibiotics is becoming a major global public health problem and a challenge for clinicians everywhere. Consequently, there is a great need for tools that help clinicians manage febrile children, particularly in resource-limited settings, so that treatments and antibiotic regimens may be guided.Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are life-threatening and annually more than 1.2 million cases of bacterial meningitis occur worldwide. Many of these occur in Sub-Saharan African areas with little or no access to laboratory diagnostics and are therefore left undiagnosed and untreated, with fatal outcomes.There is therefore a great need for diagnostic methods that are applicable to low-income settings. OBJECTIVES Development and clinical evaluation of new rapid multiplexed microarray technologies that can be applied as Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics of paediatric infections of the CNS, with a particular focus on low-income countries. METHODS Our partners at Science for Life Laboratory have through extensive research and development shown that paperbased microarray concepts might be applicable as rapid, affordable, durable, easy-to-use, reliable and highly multiplexed diagnostic methods suitable for POC analysis in low-income countries.Through the use of paperbased protein and DNA microarrays, various biofluids (blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, sputum and others.) can easily be analysed and semiquantitative measurements of different proteins and biomarkers can be presented within minutes.Levels of blood glucose or inflammatory markers such as CRP, concentrations of electrolytes or the presence of pathogens such as bacteria or viruses in biofluids, are examples of what could be visualised in a time- and resource efficient manner in a low-income setting.The project is a true translational research project where the Karolinska Institute team will work together with partners at Science for Life Laboratory and the Mbarara University of Science & Technology and MTdecins Sans FrontiFres Epicentre. We will conduct clinical evaluation studies of these novel paperbased microarray concepts of POC. The studies will be conducted at Mbarara Hospital, in South-Western Uganda.PLANNED STUDIESA)Development and optimize performance of a) novel combined affinity proteomic assay and b) novel PCR/DNA microarray assay, both amenable for POC diagnostics of paediatric CNS infection in low- and middle-income countries. B)Evaluation of the new POC techniques by applying them on 273 previously collected samples from paediatric patients in Uganda with suspected CNS infections.

"NATIONAL RESILIENCE PROGRAM. Bangladesh is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. It is exposed to seismic risk due to its location on top of the junction of three tectonic plates, cyclonic storms from the Bay of Bengal and flooding from rivers originating in the Himalayas and Myanmar. Ranked as the tenth most exposed country in the world in terms of natural hazards and the fifth most at-risk country from disasters (World Risk Report 2016), throughout its existence the country has been shaped by the impact of both extensive (low-severity, high-frequency events) and intensive (high-severity, mid-frequency to low-frequency events) natural hazards. As a result, managing disasters and their impact has been a major area of focus for the country, with investments in disaster management decreasing disaster mortality in the past four decades to 1 per cent in 2010 compared to disaster mortality in the 1970s (EM-DAT 2015). The disaster risk context, however, is changing. Ranking sixth out of the countries most affected by extreme weather events between 1995 and 2014 (Global Climate Risk Index 2016), Bangladesh has been identified as one of the countries most at risk from the negative impacts of climate change. This diagnosis is supported by studies projecting increases in incidence and intensity of extreme weather events and hazards such as soil salinization, rising sea levels and riverbank erosion (World Bank 2010a and 2010b). Recent research also indicates that the country's seismic risk may be higher than previously recognized, with an active subduction zone and megathrust fault placing the region at risk of an earthquake in the range of 8.2 to 9.0 on the Richter scale (Steckler et al. 2016). Women and girls in Bangladesh have been found to be disproportionally impacted before, during and after disasters due to persistent gender inequalities, gender-based discrimination and violence, which are often reinforced, perpetuated and exacerbated by disasters. However, women's contributions to disaster risk reduction are often overlooked, and current national disaster management systems and mechanisms are inadequate in managing risks in a gender-responsive manner. A key gap is the limited leadership of women as well as the engagement of the national gender equality machinery, women's groups and gender equality advocates and experts within the disaster risk management architecture and decision making of the country. At present, the Government of Bangladesh spends a vast amount of funds each year on social safety net programmes supporting the extreme poor and particular vulnerable groups, such as women or people affected by disaster or climate variability. By integrating disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation into social protection programmes, adaptive social protection could provide a comprehensive approach for building up the resilience of vulnerable households. Social protection programmes can be used to help households and communities reduce their risk, pla","not_global_func"
"REDUCING DIETARY RELATED RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN BANGLADESH. Bangladesh is undergoing a rapid demographic and epidemiological transition. More than 50% of deaths are attributed to non-communicable diseases and other chronic health conditions. For a country whose population exceeds 160 million, this translates into significant human and health care costs. The Government of Bangladesh recently adopted a multi-year Strategic Plan for Surveillance and Prevention of Non-Communicable Diseases that recognizes the importance of fruit and vegetable intake. Although there is government commitment, there is little relevant local research to guide the design of effective policies to combat the rising trend of non-communicable diseases.A collaboration with the University of Manitoba and the Centre for Natural Resource Studies, this project will contribute to an improved understanding of the current epidemiological transition to non-communicable diseases in Bangladesh, where no cohesive baseline data currently exists. It will generate new knowledge on the cause-and-effect relationship between changing food systems, dietary practices, and disease trends, and the associated demographic, epidemiological, sociocultural, economic, behavioural, and environmental factors. The research will improve understanding of the demand for fruit and vegetables and identify options for farmer-market-consumer initiatives that promote and support dietary shifts toward increased consumption of locally sourced vegetables. The project will also provide health and food-related policy options that respond to the current coordination gap across food, health, agriculture, and finance ministries for food systems change. It will also evaluate interventions aimed at improving consumer knowledge.  At project completion it is expected that stakeholders and the general population will have greater awareness of non-communicable diseases, associated dietary risks, and the steps towards significant dietary changes that will curb the current non-communicable diseases trend in the Bengali population.","not_global_func"

"IS BETAL QUID CHEWING IN PREGNANCY A RISK FACTOR OF METABOLIC SYNDROME AND CONTRIBUTING TO ADVERSE PREGNANCY AND INFANT OUTCOMES. A COHORT STUDY IN RU. Betel chewing is prevalent in Asia including among women in pregnancy. Betel is known as carcinogenic but little is known about health risks for mother and fetus. Studies suggest that health risks are similar to that of undernourishment in early life; adverse pregnancy outcome, poor fetal and infant growth and increased risk for metabolic syndrome in adulthood. Thus if poor nutrition and betel chewing are combined synergetic affects are plausible. Set in a rural Bangladesh the aim is to evaluate the health consequences for mother and offspring of betel chewing. A community based cohort of 4700 pregnant women will be followed repeatedly from gestation wk 8-10 until infant is 1y.

"COMBINING METABOLOMICS AND GENOMICS TO DEVELOP NEW APPROACHES FOR DIAGNOSING AND UNDERSTANDING BLOODSTREAM INFECTIONS CAUSED BY ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTAN. Bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by bacterial pathogens are a leading healthcare problem worldwide and a common cause of morbidity and mortality even in the countries with advanced healthcare systems. Treating the BSIs often demands intensive care measures including artificial ventilation and blood dialysis during such complications as multiple organ failure. The negative impact of BSI is especially pronounced in the low-income countries where the quality of the healthcare may be not capable of handling critically ill patients and/or the number of hospitals and their location is disproportional to demographic needs. Additionally, BSIs combined with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) constitute a particularly difficult problem to tackle. The infection develops quickly, the choice of effective therapies is limited and the process of selecting an appropriate treatment is slow as it involves the isolation of the etiologic agent. In case of multi-AMR of the pathogen, and lack of effective antimicrobials, medical professionals may have to fight the severe infection virtually unarmed with only empiric therapies. The grave scenario of returning to the pre-antimicrobial era is looming, and there are limited data regarding the epidemiology of AMR and BSI in low-income countries. Further, diagnostic methods for BSI are currently slow, ineffective and push healthcare personnel to administrate empirical treatment that may be not beneficial for the patient and may drive the AMR globally even further. Considering the urgent global challenges associated with AMR and BSIs, the aims of our study are:1.To investigate the burden and clinical epidemiology of BSI in a tertiary hospital in Vietnam, a lower-middle income country with a population of 90.6 million. The identification and characterization of the bacteria causing BSI will be performed in the context of AMR (using whole genome sequencing). The influence of AMR and the type of infecting pathogen on the disease outcome will be analyzed.2.To determine species specific and AMR metabolite signatures of bacteria causing BSIs. This will be performed in both blood samples from subjects with BSI and in bacterial cultures of AMR pathogens with distinct genetic backgrounds. Metabolomics data from clinical samples will be integrated with the corresponding data from genomic sequencing to produce reliable markers of AMR/BSI.3.To develop a rapid diagnostic approach for the analysis of metabolite signatures of AMR/BSI in dry blood samples. Such samples can be quickly shipped from remote areas to the bigger health centers/laboratories and we aim to analyze the efficiency and the impact of such diagnostic strategy in low-income settings in Vietnam. To achieve the identified aims we will combine cutting-edge methods as next generation bacterial genome sequencing and highly sensitive metabolite analysis with clinical data and advanced bioinformatics. Statistical significance will be secured through recruiting of 7,000 participa","AMR_Response"

"IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF A SMARTPHONE TELECONSULTATION SYSTEM FOR ACUTE BURN INJURY CARE IN RESOURCE-POOR SETTINGS. Burn injuries are a leading cause of premature death worldwide and are largely attributable to poor living conditions. Timely care is a prerequisite to reduce morbidity and mortality and it can be significantly improved in resource-poor settings by teleconsultation systems to support the provision of appropriate and timely care.A teleconsultation system for acute burn care is currently under implementation in the Western Cape, South Africa. An application (app) is installed on a smartphone located in each of the emergency services of 8 hospitals to transmit visual and textual information between emergency staff at point of care and a network of burn teleexperts. The burns specialist on call is informed via instant messaging that a case has been uploaded and can then review the visually transmitted information and images and provide diagnostic and treatment advice. The primary aim of the project is to assess how a teleconsultation system for acute burn injury care based on a smartphone application can impact on the delivery of emergency care for burns victims, both in terms of clinical management and site of care. Intermediate aims are to assess the clinical quality, clinical outcomes, user perspective, and costs and benefits of the teleconsultation system. The clinical quality will include assessments of diagnostic accuracy and patient management. Bedside diagnosis or image based diagnosis by burns experts will be used as gold standard. A historical cohort design will be used to assess the effect of the teleconsultation system on patient outcomes. The Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Model will be used to assess how the users experience the system and the system's cost-utility will be assessed in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. A stepwise implementation of the system is planned in Tanzania and Ethiopia starting the beginning of 2016. The burn specialists already involved in South Africa will act as experts for the two additional countries and the existing south-south network of emergency specialists will safeguard the communication and implementation of the system. This proposal will build on the evaluation already started in South Africa and will allow a more robust and comprehensive evaluation of the whole system. Furthermore, the inclusion of other settings will add important contextual aspects to the evaluation. The first part of the evaluation will include the hospitals currently using the teleconsultation system in the Western Cape, South Africa and 2-3 hospitals where the system will be introduced in Tanzania.

"EVALUATION OF VIRUS RETENTIVE FILTER PAPER FOR WATER TREATMENT AND CLINICAL APPLICATIONS IN REAL-LIFE STUDIES IN BANGLADESH. Cambodia is a low-income country where flooding is predicted to become more intense and frequent as climate change continues. Health systems in resource scarce settings are less resilient to absorb the shocks of disasters, leading to erosion of health system capacities. The purpose of this project is to build on an ongoing research collaboration between the NIPH and KI is to support and strengthen institutional capacities in research, education, response and policy dialogue. Between 2017 and 2019, we aim to explore the health and health system effects of flooding in Cambodia and factors that may strengthen health system resilience, by identifying morbidities and risk factors for changes in health service delivery during flood periods. We also aim to expand and provide support to the current NIPH education and training programs and build capacity for response and policy dialogue, aligned with the Cambodia disaster response system, through teacher exchanges and research-related workshops and group meetings. Improving capacity will lead to Cambodia's improved preventative and resilience capabilities in upcoming disasters.

"TARGETING SENESCENCE CELLS IN PANCREATIC CANCER. Cellular senescence is a programmed response to oncogenic stress that aims to halt the expansion of cells with malignant potential by stopping the proliferation of pre-cancerous lesions and recruitment of the immune system for their elimination. If these processes fail, senescent cells create chronic inflammation and suppress the immune response, which promotes resistance to therapy, tumor progression and tumor relapse. Using animal models and genomic engineering technologies, this project aims to eliminate senescent cells in the pancreas with a novel class of drugs developed by the research team (senolytics). The findings of this research will provide a proof of concept for new modalities of treatment against pancreatic cancer.The project is led in Canada by Dr. Gerardo Ferbeyre (UniversitT de MontrTal). His main collaborators are Dr. Valery Krizhanovsky from the Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel) and Paloma Kalegari from the Federal University of Parana (Brazil).

"REGULATION OF STEM-CELL MEDIATED HOST IMMUNITY BY THE SPHINGOLIPID PATHWAY. Changes in the functioning of the human immune system are the main cause for many diseases, including auto-immunity, infections, and cancer. Research suggests that the sphingolipid pathway plays an important role in hematopoietic stem cell functions and, as a consequence, in the generation of mature immune cells and the functioning of the surrounding environment. This project uses advanced molecular biology and genetic methods with human cells and genetically engineered mice to examine how the human immune system develops from hematopoietic stem cells and how host immunity is established. It will also explore day/night cycles that influence the functioning of the immune system in order to decipher the mechanism controlling different host immunity responses and mortality rates from bacterial infections induced in the afternoon (high mortality) and at midnight (low mortality). This research has the potential to contribute to our understanding of the immune system and to advancements in the treatment of patients. Other positive impacts can include optimized methods to generate immune cells for cell transplantation, better drugs to treat diseases that involve abnormal immune cell functioning, and better methods to time the delivery of drugs in order to achieve maximum effect. The project is led in Canada by the University Health Network and the University of Toronto, in collaboration with the Weizmann Institute (Israel) and the Oncology Hospital of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexico). It is funded through the second research competition of the Joint Canada-Israel Health Research Program, a partnership between Canada's International Development Research Centre, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, the Israel Science Foundation and the Azrieli Foundation. This 7-year, $35M Canadian-Israeli effort draws on the unique scientific strengths of both countries and facilitates networking opportunities with peers from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Projects include a plan for integrating researchers from low- and middle-income countries that will establish long-term scientific relationships.","Knowledge_Gen_Sharing"
"UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF TYPE 1 INTERFERON IN RESISTANCE TO CANCER IMMUNOTHERAPY. Chemotherapy is the main form of treatment for cancer but cannot cure most types of cancer. Immunotherapy is another form of treatment that tries to stimulate cells of the body's immune system (T cells) to kill cancer cells. Unfortunately, cancers may become resistant to T cells in the same way they learn to resist chemotherapy. This resistance is partly caused by a blood protein called interferon. This project aims to improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy. Based on previous work, the research team will investigate the use of interferon inhibitors to treat cancer cells from patients with leukemia. The choice of leukemia as a model is convenient due to large availability of cell samples. This approach is expected to increase cure rates with immunotherapy in leukemia and also many other forms of cancer. Moreover, the results of this study can open the path to the development of new innovative cancer drugs based on interferon inhibition.The project is led in Canada by Dr. David Spaner (Sunnybrook Research Institute û University of Toronto). His main collaborators are Dr. Gideon Schreiber from the Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel), and Dr. You-Jun Li from the Jilin University (China). This project was selected for funding through the third research competition of the Joint Canada-Israel Health Research Program. This initiative is a partnership between Canada's International Development Research Centre, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Israel Science Foundation and the Azrieli Foundation.","Knowledge_Gen_Sharing"

"CLIMATE CHANGE, VULNERABILITY, AND HEALTH IN COLOMBIA AND BOLIVIA. Climate change is affecting the world's natural ecosystems, according to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In Latin America, researchers have observed substantial changes in precipitation, temperature, climate variability, and the number and severity of extreme events. This project aims to assess population vulnerability and climate change impacts on waterborne and water-related diseases in Bolivia and Colombia. It will use a participatory, multistakeholder, and transdisciplinary research approach in two Andean Region watersheds, the Lauca River Basin in Bolivia and the Cauca River Basin in Colombia, to develop ecosystem and human health policy adaptation strategies. These river basins are home to indigenous communities and large urban centres, such as Cali. Although on different development paths, communities in both regions are dealing with changes in water availability and quality due to climate change. This affects commercial and subsistence agriculture. It also has important health consequences as waterborne and water-related diseases, such as diarrhea and dengue, are on the rise. Researchers will use an interdisciplinary ecosystem approach to assess population vulnerability to climate change and its impacts on human health in these two watersheds, specifically to determine population vulnerability to waterborne and water-related diseases. They will apply a watershed approach to study social and ecological systems and their interactions. This approach examines systems at a territorial level, bridging the gap between local and national. It will help ensure that researchers consider the range of environmental services to benefit people and engage multiple levels of government and social actors. It will lead to a more effective assessment of vulnerability and adaptation issues. This work will contribute knowledge to the national climate change adaptation policy process in Bolivia and Colombia. Based on the results of the two multistakeholder action research studies, researchers will propose and test adaptation strategies to improve ecosystems and human health. They will work with decision-makers and key stakeholders, especially women and indigenous people. This capacity-building approach will increase the likelihood that solutions are sustainable over the long term. These solutions will translate scientific findings into actions that transcend the health sector, improving the quality and reach of community services. They may also offer support and insight to other regional climate change adaptation initiatives by providing a better understanding of climate change vulnerability in river basins along with improved institutional research capacities.","not_global_func"

Microorganisms controldecomposition of organic matter (OM), and dominate the terrestrial contribution to the global carbon (C)cycle. Water availability is a decisive regulator of microbial processes, but they also depend on C-availability,creating a strong feedback with plants.We will investigate how microbial processes are influenced by changes in water availability across a gradientfrom cool moist to hot arid Ecosystems in Ethiopia. We will evaluate the effect of different land-uses and fieldexperimental drought on the resilience of microbial functions. Insights will be included in ecosystem models,and used to guide land-use policy in Ethiopia. The aims are:1. Defining the microbial moisture dependence, and the resilience of the microbial functions to rewetting a soil.2.

"MENTAL HEALTH FOR VULNERABLE GROUPS: A COMPLEX MULTIDISCIPLINARY MODEL COMBINING CLIENT CENTERED AND COMMUNITY APPROACHES. Continuation project ?Mental health for groups with complex needs: A multidisciplinary model combining client centred and community approacher?. The plan is to participate in four years time in the mental health strategic planning process. In previous period the Family Guidance Centers (FGC) treated 316 children who were referred to FGC. One third of them completed the treatment successfully. Among them there were 75 children with special needs. FGCs arranged special education and rehabiliation service for them. All parents express high satisfaction. During the project period concerning the coordination and development issues it started to emerge needs for changes in the setting. To tackle them and step forward organisation has decided to work on a strategic plan for mental health program. However planning has not really started maybe because of big workload but also therefore that the tacit special knowledge accumalated during 20 years is not easy to shape public and divisible. During 4 years time FiPSR will by the support of Ministry for Foreing Affairs accompany NISCVT in the strategy planning. Mental health program works in a landscape which the management and regional sciences call wicked problem. During the work FiPSR supports the basic work in two family guidance centers and rehabilitation of children with special needs in three centers. Estimated number of children is 370-420 of them 60-80 children with special needs.","not_global_func"

December 2016 - The humanitarian situation in Iraq continues to deteriorate. The violence between armed groups and government forces has displaced over 3 million people from their homes. The capacity of the Government to respond to the basic needs of its citizens has been overwhelmed. While Daesh has lost considerable territory in 2016, it is expected that humanitarian needs will remain significant in the coming years. More people will be displaced by the conflict, while many will remain displaced in camps and host communities. However, there will also be growing numbers of people returning to areas no longer under the control of Daesh who will also need assistance to help restart their lives.With GAC's support, the project is providing up to 61,000 conflict-affected people per year with comprehensive primary healthcare, including sexual and reproductive health care, mental health care, health promotion, essential medication, and emergency referral systems through static and mobile clinics. The project is also building capacity of national health actors to provide health services to Iraqis in a time of crisis though training and coaching for medical and paramedical staff, the provision of medical inputs, and the monitoring of and provision of feedback on national partners' activities./DTcembre 2016 û La situation humanitaire en Irak continue de se dTgrader.

"DIAGNOSING INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, HAVING UNDER-DEVELOPED INFRASTRUCTURES IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UN ORGAN FAO/IAEA. Defined by the WHO, zoonotic diseases are those diseases and infections that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man with or without an arthropod intermediate. Such diseases represent one of the leading causes of illness and death from infectious disease. In most developing countries, zoonotic diseases are among those diseases that contribute significantly to an already overly burdened public health system. Infectious and parasitic diseases rank second among the 'top killers' of the world and in low-income countries, especially in Africa, these diseases are even the dominant causes of death. The countrywide economic loss due to zoonotic disease is immense, cementing poverty and underdevelopment in many regions of the world.The two populations whose biological and social realities put them at greater risk for the negative impacts of zoonotic diseases are women and children.The present project will, in a multidisciplinary collaboration between a PhD student to be employed in the project and senior researchers at Uppsala University, the UN organ FAO/IAEA labs in Africa, Stockholm University, the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, develop a novel, sensitive, low-cost, diagnostics unit, providing an efficient analytical platform for detection of pathogens causing zoonotic infections in under-developed countries. The unit is based on state-of-the-art nano- and biotechnology and combines analysis of changes in rotation dynamics of probe-tagged magnetic nanobeads with a single-molecule detection approach which applies padlock ligation technique and rolling circle amplification (RCA) of the probed pathogen biomolecules (RNA and DNA). Specifically the project contains a number of well-defined, subtasks including:òOptimization and development of DNA-base detection of organisms having constant target sequence (first 18 months) and RNA-base detection of organisms having variable target sequence (year 1.5-3.5). This work includes extraction and purification of DNA/RNA target from samples received from the above mentioned labs in Africa as well as design of padlock probes and capture probes.òOptimization of the conjugation protocol used for attaching biomolecules on the surface of the magnetic nanobeads (first 24 months).òMeasurements of the RCA products formed from the new padlock probes using the bead-based magnetic bioassay in a commercial AC suceptometer (year 2-3.5). This includes: Determining the limit of detection for the different pathogens, detection of antimicrobial resistance and resistant clones (salmonella and campylobacter), detection of a wide range of different strains of E. coli, investigation of mixed viral populations, subpopulations and individual copies of Avian influenza virus, West Nile virus and Rift Valley Fever virus in clinical samples, introducing new variants of the three viruses in the diagnostic assay.òDetection of pathogen targets in a working prototype","Knowledge_Gen_Sharing"

Infectious and parasitic diseases rank second among the 'top killers' of the world and in low-income countries, especially in Africa, these diseases are even the dominant causes of death. The countrywide economic loss due to zoonotic disease is immense, cementing poverty and underdevelopment in many regions of the world.The two populations whose biological and social realities put them at greater risk for the negative impacts of zoonotic diseases are women and children.The present project will, in a multidisciplinary collaboration between a PhD student to be employed in the project and senior researchers at Uppsala University, the UN organ FAO/IAEA labs in Africa, Stockholm University, the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, develop a novel, sensitive, low-cost, diagnostics unit, providing an efficient analytical platform for detection of pathogens causing zoonotic infections in under-developed countries. The unit is based on state-of-the-art nano- and biotechnology and combines analysis of changes in rotation dynamics of probe-tagged magnetic nanobeads with a single-molecule detection approach which applies padlock ligation technique and rolling circle amplification (RCA) of the probed pathogen biomolecules (RNA and DNA). Specifically the project contains a number of well-defined, subtasks including:òOptimization and development of DNA-base detection of organisms having constant target sequence (first 18 months) and RNA-base detection of organisms having variable target sequence (year 1.5-3.5). This work includes extraction and purification of DNA/RNA target from samples received from the above mentioned labs in Africa as well as design of padlock probes and capture probes.òOptimization of the conjugation protocol used for attaching biomolecules on the surface of the magnetic nanobeads (first 24 months).òMeasurements of the RCA products formed from the new padlock probes using the bead-based magnetic bioassay in a commercial AC suceptometer (year 2-3.5). This includes: Determining the limit of detection for the different pathogens, detection of antimicrobial resistance and resistant clones (salmonella and campylobacter), detection of a wide range of different strains of E. coli, investigation of mixed viral populations, subpopulations and individual copies of Avian influenza virus, West Nile virus and Rift Valley Fever virus in clinical samples, introducing new variants of the three viruses in the diagnostic assay.òDetection of pathogen targets in a working prototype","Knowledge_Gen_Sharing"
"FOSTERING SWEDEN-MALAYSIA RESEARCH PARTNERSHIP: ENHANCING RESEARCH CAPACITY AND COMPETENCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EARLY WARNING OF DENGUE, A CLIMAT. Dengue fever, a viral infected disease transmitted by mosquitoes (vector), is a major public health challenge in Malaysia despite the fact that concerted surveillance and control efforts are in place. An early warning with precise forecast of outbreak allows timely decision-making and mitigation. Such epidemic prediction capability is not demonstrated in current surveillance system. In early 2014, researchers from Umea University have initiated a multidisciplinary and multinational collaboration for the development of a dengue early warning system for Singapore and Malaysia. Umes researchers possess substantial experience in disease forecasting modeling using various statistical and mathematical techniques. This project promotes research capacity and expertise required for disease forecast. Activities such as workshops, seminars and visits to Disease Control Division are planned to facilitate exchange or transfer of knowledge or ideas and develop strategies for studies including forecast of dengue, development of early warning system, economic evaluation and information distribution. Subsequently, knowledge and experience gained will be translated as course modules for graduate students in the University of Malaya. Anticipated outcomes include long-term research partnership and advance knowledge of disease early warning that may contribute to reducing burden of dengue and promote healthy living and wellbeing in the community.","not_global_func"

"MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMME IN TANZANIAN PRISONS. DEVELOPMENT TARGETThe goal is to ensure better psychiatric health for inmates during and after the prison term and furthering their integration back into normal society.DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMIn Tanzanian prisons care of psychiatric patients is insufficient and lacking in quality. These inmates belong to most vulnarable groups in the country.MAIN GOALSIn this 3-year exit phase of the project:-A good standard of psychiatric care in Tanzanian prisons is maintained after the project.-The actual state of psychiatric problems in Tanzanian prisons is documented to be used for future planning and follow-up.CROSS-CUTTING DEVELOPMENT POLICY1. Gender equality: The only female and youth prisons in Tanzania are included in the project.2. Reducing unequality in prisons by better psychiatric treatment of prisoners and thus improving their survival in society after prison.CREATING NEW STRUCTURESNew network will ensure sustainable support to the health care personnel in each Tanzanian prison to identify diagnose and treat psychiatric patients. By law the district psychiatric nurses are to visit prisons yearly MAIN BENEFICIARIESPrisoners with psychiatric problems upon arrival and those whose problems have manifested during the prison termKEY PROJECT ACTIVITIES1. Form a NETWORK to ensure the standard of psychiatric care in Tanzanian prisons. Create a system where the doctor and nurse of each Tanzanian prison will be visited once a year by a specialised psychiatric professional in form of supervision and follow-up. 30 psychiatric district coordinators will attend an orientating course on psychiatric problems in prisons for that purpose. The course will also be attended by 7 prison nurses specialised in psychiatry as well as 2 prison doctors currently specialising in psychiatry2. Survey study on mental health problems in Tanzanian prisons suggested by The Head of Tanzanian Prisons. It was also introduced to us by our Embassy already since 2012. The study will be carried out by our partner organisation MEHATA in cooperation with the Tanzanian Prison Services. The study will serve as basis for any future plans developing psychiatric care in Tanzanian prisons","not_global_func"

"IMPROVING MICROPHAGE INNATE IMMUNITY BY MODULATING PROTEIN TYROSINE PHOSPHATASES: THE COMPLETE MOUSE AND HUMAN PTPOMES. Diseases that result from an infection are most often resolved by cells that use an immune response to clear foreign agents. These cells include macrophages, which are the predominant type of cell that eliminates infectious agents in a process called phagocytosis, or eating the foreign particles. There are two specialized subsets of macrophages: pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory macrophages. This research focuses on the pro-inflammatory macrophages, also called M1, which are responsible for triggering an immune response against infectious agents to promote their killing.This project investigates the therapeutic potential of inhibiting a class of proteins named protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) to treat infectious diseases. Recent findings suggest that mice in which PTP-RO is inhibited have an increased number of macrophages in the bone marrow, while PTP-1B leads to a pro-inflammatory response in macrophages. The authors hypothesize that certain PTPs favour the generation of the pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, thereby regulating the functions leading to promoting immune surveillance and killing of infectious agents. The project proposes that regulating the expression and activity of these PTPs may improve the function of these macrophages and promote better anti-pathogenic responses. The research will improve understanding of infectious disease progression and contribute to the development of new methods of treatment for infectious diseases by regulating specific PTPs. The project is led in Canada by McGill University, with the collaboration of the Weizmann Institute (Israel) and the University of Hyderabad (India). This project was selected and approved for funding through the second research competition of the Joint Canada-Israel Health Research Program, a partnership between Canada's International Development Research Centre, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, the Israel Science Foundation, and the Azrieli Foundation. This 7-year, $35M Canadian-Israeli effort draws on the unique scientific strengths of both countries and facilitates networking opportunities with peers from Africa, Asia, and Latin America. All projects include a plan for integrating researchers from low- and middle-income countries that will establish long-term scientific relationships.","Knowledge_Gen_Sharing"

"ESTABLISHMENT OF A REGIONAL QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE PHARMACEUTICAL SECTOR. During the past few years, a pharmaceutical industry has developed in East Africa which pro-duces not only generics but also pharmaceutical products it has developed on its own. On the one hand, the pharmaceutical sector thus contributes to improved medical care for the popu-lation and, on the other hand, imports of pharmaceutical products could be reduced. Most pharmaceutical enterprises, however, are only allowed to produce for their own domestic market. They are excluded from tendering for the large-scale orders of donors (such as the WHO or the Global Fund) because they cannot prove that they will comply with the respec-tive quality standards. For the approval and market surveillance of pharmaceuticals in the member states of the East African Community (EAC), special regulatory authorities and control laboratories are responsible whose technical capability and staff do not suffice to protect the market effectively from qualitatively insufficient products.","not_global_func"

"WILDLIFE-RELATED ZOONOTIC DISEASES AMONG PASTORALISTS IN UGANDA. Emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are of increasing concern worldwide. Most of these diseases are of animal origin (zoonotic). While risk of zoonotic disease is related to wildlife-livestock-human interaction, it is amplified by poverty, environmental degradation and social vulnerability. The East African context presents a high-risk situation. Livestock and wild animals come into close contact while using limited water resources and pastures near national parks and tourist resorts. Disease transmission from wildlife to livestock and people affects community development, public health, food security, wildlife protection and business (tourism, value chains). Using an Ecohealth approach, researchers will conduct a serological survey to determine the distribution of major zoonotic diseases among pastoral communities, livestock and wildlife in proximity to a national park. They will carry out ecological, social and economic studies to assess the impact of such diseases on public health and income generation (value chains, tourism). And, they will develop multi-stakeholder strategies to reduce vulnerability and risk with respect to zoonotic diseases among pastoralist communities in the Ugandan cattle corridor. The project is expected to generate results that can be used to guide public health and development policies across various sectors.","not_global_func"

"MONITORING AND EVALUATION: ASSISTING VULNERABLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN BORDER AREAS/SUIVI ET +VALUATIONA: AIDER LES FEMMES ET ENFANTS VULN+RABLES DANS. Ensure monitoring and evaluation of the project.This project aims to prevent human trafficking and protect vulnerable Haitian migrants especially children and women. Haiti is a major source of migrants and every year, thousands of Haitians seek better socio-economic opportunities in the Dominican Republic. The two countries share 360 km of extremely porous border, with only four official border points. The majority of migratory movements from Haiti is made from informal crossing points, hence illegal. Lacking legal status and documentation, illegal border crossers frequently fall victim to violence, abuse or exploitation, especially children and women.With Global Affairs Canada's support, the International Organization for Migration is increasing protection mechanisms in border areas to combat human trafficking, especially child and women trafficking and exploitation. Project activities include: (1) training 400 local governmental officers and civil society actors on standardized procedures and protection principles (including prevention and reintegration aspects); (2) establishing a common standardized data management system for the registration of migrants; (3) establishing and operationalizing four border resource centres (BRC) at official crossing points; (4) rehabilitating or refurbishing eight reception centres in Ouanaminthe, Belladere and Fonds-Parisien; (5) providing reintegration assistance at border to 2,000 vulnerable migrants (e.g. emergency shelter and domestic items); (6) providing adequate livelihoods assistance/education grants to 500 vulnerable migrants; and (7) developing a total of 16 awareness/sensitization campaign targeting more than 737,000 Haitians living in bordering communes on the dangers of irregular border crossings and on how to report cases of exploitation and abuse./ Assurer le suivi et l'Tvaluation du projet.Ce projet vise a prTvenir la traite des personnes et protTger les enfants et les femmes vulnTrables, en particulier les migrants.

"COLLABORATIVE STUDIES OF T CELL RESPONSES TO ENTEROTOXIGENIC E. COLI AND H. PYLORI INFECTIONS TO SUPPORT VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND SCIENTIFIC TRAINING R. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) are common infections in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). ETEC gives rise to watery diarrhea, causing 400 000 deaths/year, primarily in young children. LMIC children are also often chronically infected with Hp and in 15-20% of cases, the infection causes symptoms later in life such as peptic ulcers or gastric cancer. Our recent results suggest that CD4+ T helper cells, particularly those that secrete the cytokine IL-17A (Th17), play important roles in promoting protective immune mechanisms in both infections. The overall aim of this project is to advance the knowledge we have recently gained on Th17 responses in different model systems to human ETEC and Hp infection. This includes (I) to characterize T helper cell responses to these infections in humans and (II) to study the functional capacity of novel mucosal vaccine adjuvants to enhance human CD4+ T helper cell responses. This collaborative project, performed at the University of Gothenburg and the International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, will benefit from the combined expertise of the applicants, including broad knowledge in techniques for analyzing T cell responses and extensive experience of studies of mucosal immunity in LMIC. The project also aims to establish a framework for mutual learning and training of PhD students and younger scientists at both sites, forming a basis for extended future collaboration.","Knowledge_Gen_Sharing"

"SCALING UP CARE FOR PERINATAL DEPRESSION FOR IMPROVED MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH IN NIGERIA (IMCHA). Even though effective treatments are available, perinatal depression often goes untreated, especially in low- and middle-income countries where there are shortages of mental health specialist resources.  This project aims to address that challenge by demonstrating how community midwives who are trained to work in resource-constrained settings can deliver effective interventions for depression among new mothers.Community treatments for depression The World Health Organization (WHO) produced the Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide to help non-specialists recognize and treat select mental health conditions, including perinatal depression. The project team will test the guide's effectiveness in providing support to mothers with perinatal depression at the community level. Using a participatory research approach, researchers will implement training for community midwives in Osun State, Nigeria. The training aims to enhance their skills so they can identify and support women with perinatal depression. The research will also identify organizational factors that can support the scaling up of mental health services in Nigeria. The project will help generate knowledge on the training methods that can equip midwives with skills to deliver care for perinatal depression. The findings will help strengthen efforts in other low- and middle-income countries to develop relevant strategies and programs to address perinatal depression.Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in AfricaThis project is part of the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa program, a seven-year $36 million initiative funded by Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD), Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).","not_global_func"

"FEED THE FUTURE INDIA TRIANGULAR TRAINING PROGRAM. Feed the Future India Triangular Training Program: USAID partners with the Indian Ministry of Agriculture's premier institute - the National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management (MANAGE) - to train 1,500 agricultural practitioners from 11 African and 6 Asian countries on specialized farming practices to improve productivity and income. Phase I of the program trained 219 participants from Kenya, Liberia, and Malawi in agricultural marketing, dairy management, food processing and other best practices to prevent post-harvest losses. These farmers, food processors, extension workers, and policymakers are now implementing new farming practices that improve food and nutritional security in their countries and regions. Following the successes of these three countries, Phase II, launched in 2016, expanded to include training for hundreds of additional professionals, helping increase the agricultural stability of 17 target countries. A total of 44 training programs including 32 based in India and 12 based in the target countries will be completed by March 2020. As of September 2017, ten programs were implemented involving 289 trainees.","not_global_func"

"ECONOMICS OF TOBACCO CONTROL RESEARCH INITIATIVE: OPERATING COSTS FOR CAPACITY BUILDING. Fiscal policies for tobacco-control have been widely recognized as the most effective measures to curb tobacco consumption and prevent tobacco-related diseases, while reducing household poverty and increasing national revenues. Yet, most low- and middle-income countries have not effectively implemented such policies to date. Common barriers include competing health and development priorities, as well as a lack of knowledge about country- or region-specific health and economic burdens related to tobacco and potential benefits of policies. Industry opposition and common misinformed beliefs about the economic benefits of the tobacco industry (including arguments around reducing illicit trade, harm to tobacco farmers and other industry-related employment, etc.) also present barriers to tobacco control policy in many LMICs.  Through the Economics of Tobacco Control Research Initiative, Cancer Research UK and Canada's International Development Research Centre aim to address the development challenges posed by tobacco use in low- and middle-income countries. The countries where research will be carried out will be determined through the competitive research call process. By supporting research on the economics of tobacco control in LMICs, this five-year Initiative will allow the generation of the local evidence that is acutely needed to implement fiscal and policy solutions for effective tobacco control. Beyond the generation of evidence, this initiative will support collaborations between multiple institutions within countries or regions to enable research teams to actively engage in policy dialogue and policy-making processes. Local evidence will provide the context-specific information and tools needed to help countries leap forward with tobacco-control policy and contribute to SDG targets with respect to health and economic empowerment. This project appraisal is for authorisation to cover the human resource cost of a full time Senior Program Officer to manage the project, associated travel and office costs over the course of the five year initiative. The staff under the initiative will be responsible for the delivery and monitoring of the research projects selected through the competitive call, as well as communications about the Initiative, and reporting to the Governance Committee.","Response_Unhealthy_Products"

"REGULATION OF FOOD AND BEVERAGE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING IN INDIA. Foods and beverages rich in salt, sugar, calories, and saturated fats, but deficient in micronutrients, have flooded Indian food markets. Indian consumers are showing an increased preference for them. This project will help strengthen Indian policies for regulating advertising and marketing of food and beverage products in the country. Increase in non-communicable diseases When coupled with low physical activity and unhealthy lifestyle practices, these unhealthy foods and beverages are increasing the non-communicable disease burden and risk factors such as overweight and obesity. At the same time, there has been a surge in innovative, misleading advertising and marketing that targets minors to promote unhealthy foods and beverages. One recommended strategy to curb the growing obesity epidemic is to restrict advertising and promotion of unhealthy food products targeting youth. While India has food advertising and promotion regulations, implementation is based on self-regulation. This has proven to be an ineffective strategy. Toward healthier lifestyle choices This two-year project will: -analyze and identify policy gaps related to the advertising and promotion of unhealthy foods and beverages to Indian children and adolescents -assess the extent to which Indian adolescents are receptive to food marketing, both in their perceptions and behaviours -provide evidence-based recommendations to make existing regulations more effective The project team will engage stakeholders to ensure that the research recommendations will influence the Government of India's food policy agenda.","not_global_func"

The project will develop a sound evidence base for the promotion of an effective FOP food labelling system in Argentina and Brazil. The current political context presents an opportunity to move forward with policy discussions. However, interested stakeholders need to have a better understanding of the legal and economic implications under the current regional and international economic agreements in place. The aim of this multi-component research study is to promote effective evidence-based mandatory FOP food labelling systems in Brazil and Argentina, support policy discussions, and assess the factors affecting its adoption in the rest of MERCOSUR countries. This research will study the regulatory and policy framework, analyze to which extent gender dimensions are considered, assess the political facilitators and barriers affecting the introduction of a FOP labelling system, analyze the arguments used by superior legal courts of products that can pose risks to public health (as tobacco or asbestos), and assess the arguments used by the food industry to hinder the promotion of FOP labelling. In Brazil, the national regulatory health agency is already considering novel FOP food labelling alternatives. In Argentina, the project team will work with strategic stakeholders to assess the most suitable FOP labelling system to be applied. The project will enable a process of inter-country and multi-actor collaboration and increase the regional capacities in this domain. Expected research outcomes include: evidence-based legal and technical recommendations to promote FOP food labelling systems in the MERCOSUR countries; extrapolation of legal arguments used in other public health cases to food labelling policy-discussions; commonly-agreed counter-arguments to those presented by the food industry in policy processes in the region; and the determination of the most suitable FOP labelling system in Argentina.","Knowledge_Gen_Sharing"

"DEVELOPMENT OF A MUCOSAL VACCINE AGAINST HELICOBACTER PYLORI INFECTION INCLUDING PHASE I CLINICAL TESTING IN INDIA. Gastric Helicobacter pylori infection is the main cause of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Remarkably, an estimated 80-90% of the adults in low and middle income countries are infected with H. pylori. An estimated 10-15% of the infected individuals will develop peptic ulcer disease and 1-2% gastric cancer. Antibiotic treatment can cure peptic ulcer disease but reinfection is common. From a public health perspective, a vaccine against H. pylori will reduce the consumption of antibiotics, the incidence of associated symptoms and rate of reinfections. The main target group for such a vaccine would be adults in low and middle income countries where H. pylori infection is endemic. Our group at the University of Gothenburg (UG) has been working for the last 20 years on the development of a mucosally delivered vaccine against H. pylori infection. Based on the results from our pre-clinical studies, a vaccine candidate will be chosen to advance to Phase I clinical trials in H. pylori infected adults and later in children in close collaboration with an industrial partner. The vaccine will be scaled up for production under GMP conditions. Pre-vaccine specific immune responses in H. pylori infected individuals in India will be studied and a Phase I trial will be carried out in India. Considering the previous experience at UG in developing mucosal vaccines, we are optimistic that we could develop an effective and low-cost H. pylori vaccine under the framework of this application.","not_global_func"
