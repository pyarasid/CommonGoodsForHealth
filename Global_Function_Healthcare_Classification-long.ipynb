Even though effective treatments are available, perinatal depression often goes untreated, especially in low- and middle-income countries where there are shortages of mental health specialist resources.  This project aims to address that challenge by demonstrating how community midwives who are trained to work in resource-constrained settings can deliver effective interventions for depression among new mothers.Community treatments for depression The World Health Organization (WHO) produced the Mental Health Gap Action Programme Intervention Guide to help non-specialists recognize and treat select mental health conditions, including perinatal depression. The project team will test the guide's effectiveness in providing support to mothers with perinatal depression at the community level. Using a participatory research approach, researchers will implement training for community midwives in Osun State, Nigeria. The training aims to enhance their skills so they can identify and support women with perinatal depression. The research will also identify organizational factors that can support the scaling up of mental health services in Nigeria. The project will help generate knowledge on the training methods that can equip midwives with skills to deliver care for perinatal depression.

The most important achievement of the grant has been its contribution to the low-prevalence of HIV in Bangladesh. Many countries experienced explosive increase of HIV from the epidemic of Injecting Drug Users (IDU). To a large degree, due to the activities supported by the grant this did not occur in Bangladesh. IDUs and Female Sex Workers (FSWs) are the focus of the grant. At the end of Phase 1 of the RCC Grant (December 2011), the performance of the grant against its targets was considered satisfactory. The average performance on the Top 10 indicators was 96% (A2). All indicators rating was at 98% (A2). Out of 14 Service Delivery Area indicators, 6 were overachieved, 5 were between 90-100%; two indicators were slightly below 90% and one - 'Number of IDU and FSW reached through Peer Education' - was at 68% and rapidly catching up from the previous level of 50%. The underachievement was partially due to the discontinuation of a Sub-Recipient (SR) agreement in September 2011 with an entity that was ensuring the coverage of up to one-third of IDU targets. The discontinuation of this SR agreement followed an investigation by the Global Fund's Office of the Inspector General which found disturbing signs of fraudulent practices by the SR. The PR acted decisively in order to safeguard the Global Fund money and took over the direct implementation of IDU-related activities. As a result, the PR managed to maintain the expected return of the grant by avoiding the prolonged discontinuation of preventive activities for IDUs, while at the same time reducing further risk.Overall, it is expected that a good level of performance will be maintained throughout the time remaining until the end of Phase 1 (in November 30, 2012) and, pending the Phase 2 approval, beyond Phase 1.'---1. Background and Summary:  With estimated HIV prevalence of less than 0.1% (2009 UNAIDS Country Brief), Bangladesh is a low HIV prevalence country. UNAIDS estimates about 12,000 people in Bangladesh to be living with HIV at the end of 2007. As of December 2008, a total of 1495 cases of HIV infection were confirmed, with 476 of them developing AIDS and 165 reported death cases (National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan). The Sero Surveillance Report findings show that HIV infection rate is increasing among most-at-risk-population (MARP), particularly among injecting drug users (IDUs) with concentrated epidemic in Dhaka (7%), and among female sex workers (FSW) due to low level of condom use.Despite the low HIV prevalence in Bangladesh, several risk factors, including geographical location, high population mobility, a large number of migrant workers, poverty, and low level of awareness among young people threaten to hamper the continuing status of Bangladesh as a low HIV prevalence country. The HIV Joint Monitoring Mission organized by the World Bank and its key partners in February 2009 found that prompt and vigorous action is needed to strengthen the quality and coverage of HIV prevention programs,\",\n",

Background:  Brief overview of the FA collaboration during the past5 -year period (FA3). During the past 5 -year period, the FA institutional collaboration between ITM and LRM has improved LRM capacity in several domains:  -  -LRM has recently been designated as a supranational reference laboratory candidate for TB by the WHO and serves as a center of excellence for other countries in the West/ Central African Region  - LRM has established a well -functioning lab network for BU diagnosis with a specific manual available, conducts regular supervisions of peripheral labs, and completes external quality controls showing excellent results. This can serve as an example for other countries in the region  - Several PhDs have been defended by students from LRM and an increasing number of research articles are authored by LRM staff  Previous institutional collaborations between LRM and ITM were under FA1 (1998 -2002), FA2 (2003 -2007), FA3 -I (2008 -2010) and FA3 -II (2010 to 2013). Below are reports for the past 5 -year period: Progress 2012 A well -functioning lab network for BU diagnosis is now in place in Benin with a specific manual available, regular supervisions of peripheral labs and external quality controls showing excellent results.  LRM has also set up qPCR for BU diagnosis and a second study has been performed to compare it with classical PCR, which showed an increase in positivity rate of 33%. This technique has now been adopted at LRM and is routinely used on samples received from BU centres. However, new changes on the probe used for this technology suggest further improvements of the performance of this test are possible. Though it was not possible to establish formal links between LRM and labs from other countries, some lab technicians have been received from these countries for training. In addition, samples from BU suspected cases from neighbouring countries are received at LRM, and analysed with the different tests available. Finally, the differential diagnosis study is ongoing with more than 100 patients recruited to date.  Progress 2011 Activities to maintain a well -established laboratory for BU diagnosis in West -Africa as well as a good national microscopy network have been maintained and strengthened: National guidelines for the BU microscopy network have been validated and printed. The equipment for real time PCR has been provided to LRM by ITM, LRM staff has been trained on this technique which has been set up and is now routinely used in this laboratory. Samples from field centers (patients from Benin as well as from neighbouring countries) have been tested for BU diagnosis and peripheral laboratories were regularly supervised and controlled. In terms of research activities in 2011, two researchers from DRC have been received at LRM for joint training on immunological tests on BU. Studies to improve DNA extraction have been published (Affolabi et al., 2012). Other currently ongoing research focuses on drug susceptibility test',\n",

The school feeding system in China provides 180 to 200 days of meals a year to rural children from economically disadvantaged provinces that have a high incidence of malnutrition. The program covers 14 provinces, 100 counties, and over three million children. In order to make policy adjustments and expand the benefits to other low-income areas of the country, it is essential to measure the impact of the system. The purpose of this study is to assess China's school feeding system under its National Nutrition Improvement Plan to better understand the system's impact on rural students, local food security, and sustainable economic growth. Researchers will assess the quality of the meals and nutrient intake by children aged seven to 15 in relation to their health and nutritional status, school attendance, and educational outcomes. Economic impact on local communities will be monitored to understand if and how the system affects local food production, procurement, and employment, particularly for women. To improve the potential impacts of the system on nutritional outcomes, additional interventions (including nutrition education and capacity development for women and men) will be introduced in a selected number of schools over a period of two years, and their impact will be evaluated.     The project will be led by the China Development Research Foundation (CDRF) in collaboration with several strategic participating institutions, including the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Food Program, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture, Microsoft, Amway Charity Foundation, and the Capital Healthcare and Nutrition Cuisine Society.

IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF A SMARTPHONE TELECONSULTATION SYSTEM FOR ACUTE BURN INJURY CARE IN RESOURCE-POOR SETTINGS. Burn injuries are a leading cause of premature death worldwide and are largely attributable to poor living conditions. Timely care is a prerequisite to reduce morbidity and mortality and it can be significantly improved in resource-poor settings by teleconsultation systems to support the provision of appropriate and timely care.A teleconsultation system for acute burn care is currently under implementation in the Western Cape, South Africa. An application (app) is installed on a smartphone located in each of the emergency services of 8 hospitals to transmit visual and textual information between emergency staff at point of care and a network of burn teleexperts. The burns specialist on call is informed via instant messaging that a case has been uploaded and can then review the visually transmitted information and images and provide diagnostic and treatment advice. The primary aim of the project is to assess how a teleconsultation system for acute burn injury care based on a smartphone application can impact on the delivery of emergency care for burns victims, both in terms of clinical management and site of care. Intermediate aims are to assess the clinical quality, clinical outcomes, user perspective, and costs and benefits of the teleconsultation system. The clinical quality will include assessments of diagnostic accuracy and patient management. Bedside diagnosis or image based diagnosis by burns experts will be used as gold standard. A historical cohort design will be used to assess the effect of the teleconsultation system on patient outcomes. The Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Model will be used to assess how the users experience the system and the system's cost-utility will be assessed in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. A stepwise implementation of the system is planned in Tanzania and Ethiopia starting the beginning of 2016. The burn specialists already involved in South Africa will act as experts for the two additional countries and the existing south-south network of emergency specialists will safeguard the communication and implementation of the system. This proposal will build on the evaluation already started in South Africa and will allow a more robust and comprehensive evaluation of the whole system. Furthermore, the inclusion of other settings will add important contextual aspects to the evaluation. The first part of the evaluation will include the hospitals currently using the teleconsultation system in the Western Cape, South Africa and 2-3 hospitals where the system will be introduced in Tanzania. Later on, 2-3 hospitals in Ethiopia will be introduced to the system, informed by the process in Tanzania, and those hospitals will be included in the evaluation.Low cost and timely alternatives to burn injury control are a pressing need in many low- and middle-income settings and countries.

STREAMLINING THE RESPONSE TO HIV/AIDS  EPIDEMIC IN AZERBAIJAN BY STRENGTHENING NATIONAL CAPACITIES AND SCALING UP PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. Azerbaijan is a lower-middle income country with a concentrated HIV epidemic. HIV prevalence in adults is estimated at 0.2 percent (UNAIDS, 2008 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic). Although the national burden of HIV appears comparatively low, it is probably underestimated - due, in particular, to difficulties in accessing most-at-risk population groups. The predominant HIV transmission mode is sharing of injecting equipment among people who inject drugs. The government of Azerbaijan is committed to fighting the HIV epidemic and allocates increasing amounts of financial, human and infrastructural resources for this purpose, particularly to cover the substantial costs of staff, medical interventions and facility expenses. However, substantial financial and programmatic gaps exist, especially with regards to the complex and costly interventions in HIV prevention and treatment activities among most-at-risk population groups. The program supported by this grant aims to ensure the continuation and scaling-up of the activities initiated under the Round 4-supported program, which ended in June 2010. This program will initiate new activities, such as expansion of voluntary counseling and testing, ensuring universal access to prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and establishing community-based care and support.',\n",

The Government of Bangladesh with the assistance of ADB implemented the First Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-I) from March 1998 to June 2005.  The Second Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-II), supported by ADB and the Governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden, commenced in July 2005 and was completed in December 2012.  A provision of $50 million has been made for the Bangladesh Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project (UPHCSDP) in ADB's lending pipeline for 2012 in addition to $400,000 grant support for Supporting the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project in 2012. The UPHCSDP and the grant continue the provision of urban PHC, among others, through successful PPPs pioneered by UPHCP-I and II.   With a density of 2,756 people per square kilometer (km2) in urban areas and 843 people per km2 overall, Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world (excluding a few city-states).  Bangladesh is urbanizing at a rapid pace and the country's urban population is expected to reach 89.5 million (from 39.5 million in 2005) by 2030.  According to one estimate, by 2020 the urban poor figure could be as high as 40%-60% of the urban population.  Notwithstanding higher economic growth in urban areas, the absolute number of poor households is increasing in urban Bangladesh due to migration of rural poor into urban areas. Studies have shown that the health indicators of the urban poor are as worse as those of the rural poor because of poorer living conditions, and limited urban PHC. Failure to provide urban PHC can have serious negative externalities - spread of communicable diseases, debilitating epidemics, reduction in economic productivity, among others.\",\n",

A detailed evaluation is critical not only to keep improving the scheme, but also to ensure that the lessons learned from it benefit other states and countries. The Aarogyasri Trust Board has therefore asked a consortium of institutions to evaluate the scheme and consider its potential role in prevention and primary healthcare. This project is a response to that request. The evaluation will also establish a baseline for future evaluations, identify areas for further research, and build capacity for research, evaluation and evidence-based policymaking in India.',\n",

DEVELOPMENTAL ORIGINS OF HEALTH AND DISEASE: EQUITABLE PREVENTION ACROSS GENERATIONS? FOLLOW-UP OF THE MINIMAT RANDOMIZED TRIAL IN BANGLADESH. This project - follow-up of the MINIMat trial - is implemented in Bangladesh, in a context, where food insecurity and maternal malnutrition still prevail, but where changing lifestyles and economic growth potentially increase the risk for future chronic disease of the offspring. Pregnant women were randomised to an early (E) start of prenatal food supplementation vs. usual program start, and multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) vs. iron-folate. Participants were followed-up for primary outcomes (maternal haemoglobin, birth weight, and infant survival) and for a series of secondary outcomes based on the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease hypothesis. So far we have demonstrated a remarkable effect of E-MMS on infant and under-five survival, and effects of the interventions on childhood stunting and metabolic markers at 4.5 years. We aim at studying whether the effects of the prenatal interventions on growth and metabolic markers up to 4.5 years are sustained at 10 years, to evaluate if these interventions reduce health disparities, and whether social conditions and maternal stressors modify the effect on children of the interventions, and to analyse the public health impact and the cost-utility of the interventions in order to inform policy and possibilities for scaling-up.',\n",

The main focus is to reduce stigmatization and discrimination of PLHA. The overall objectives of GSP are to strengthen the involvement of churches in  response to HIV by enabling people and organizations to: Get knowledge about HIV and AIDS and risky behaviour; Encourage VCT and sexual education; Eradicate stigma and discrimination; Restore PLHA?s human rights dignity and equality and; To renew churches and local congregations' social responsibility. The programme has two main target groups: People with influence as opinion leaders and/or with the capacity to act as facilitators and trainers; and people who are particularly vulnerable to HIV  such as the youth women PLHA  and married couples. Third phase  is especially  targeting PVDs  as they are one of the most HIV vulnerable groups. Through PVD strategy the aim is to include PVDs to existing structure of activities. The strategy is based on Information Education and Communication with a focus on behavioral change communication and to work with individuals and communities through sharing and providing supportive and enabling environments. The implementation is based on a two tier strategy: (i) advocacy sensitization and mobilization of community&religious leaders; and (ii) conduct training of trainers to reach local communities.

MIGRATION, REMITTANCES, AND FOREST DEPENDENCE IN ETHIOPIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD SECURITY, GENDER, AND FOREST CONSERVATION. This project will provide evidence that offers important insight into the connection between migration, gender, and forest dependence in rural Ethiopia. Need for labour migration, forest resources While most rural households rely on agriculture for their livelihood, many poor households in developing countries use labour migration and forest resources to improve their welfare. Existing research offers simplistic assumptions that migration invariably leads to deforestation in the tropics, and that forest recovery is always a consequence of people leaving rural areas. These assumptions are being questioned, particularly as researchers analyze and document the complex factors that influence migration outcomes. As a result, it is not clear whether labour migration complements, or serves as a substitute, for forest product extraction by migrant-sending households. Furthermore, whether and how labour migration influences intra-household gender relations, food security, and forest dependence at the places of origin is unclear. Insights into the effects on households The Ethiopian Economic Association/Ethiopian Economic Policy Research Institute (EEA-EEPRI) will collaborate with the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) on this project. They will explore the effects of migration and remittances on household forest dependence, food security, and intra-household gender division of work. Researchers will investigate the degree to which those effects vary across different migration types (for example, domestic versus international migration, and rural versus urban) and across socio-economic groups and locations. A better understanding of these issues is of crucial importance in Ethiopia for a number of reasons. The government has formulated and implemented specific policies on gender, forestry, and food security. However, the ways in which rural out-migration is influencing the achievement of gender equity, forest conservation, and rural food security goals are not well understood. This research will aim to propose options for policymakers and development partners. Project leadership This project is made possible through the Think Tank Initiative (TTI).

Due to weak quality, inclusiveness (e.g. youth-friendliness), and gender-responsiveness of health services delivery and health care management, service delivery, operationalization and increased access and utilization of maternal newborn child health/sexual and reproductive health services (MNCH/SRH) require support. Specific challenges include: 1) weak health seeking behaviour by disadvantaged, vulnerable and marginalised women of child bearing age (WCBA) and their families; Particularly high MNCH/SRH risks exist for adolescent mothers and high rates of child, early, and forced marriage (CEFM); 3) WCBA's lack of decision-making capacity and low access to and control over social and economic assets due, to pervasive gender inequality; 4) inaccessible, fragmented and client-unfriendly health systems; 5) low numbers and inadequate skills of Community Health Workers and frontline workers to provide quality, gender responsive, adolescent friendly health care; and 6) irregular tracking and use of data by Ministry of Health, and poor accountability of health services to local communities.Project activities include: (1) raising awareness of local leaders, role models and various community groups on ongoing MNCH services, positive healthcare practices, including health care seeking behaviours; (2) training health care providers at both community and health facility levels on key MNCH interventions; (3) providing essential medicines and other medical supplies; (4) training health administrators and local health committees on planning, supervision and oversight of health resources and facilities; (5) training for health workers and drivers in referring patients requiring more advanced care at specialized facilities, including providing health facilities with mobile technology and vehicles to facilitate emergency transportation; (6) training and mentoring health care staff on improved data collection and reporting to inform local government resource planning; and, (7) implementing digital and media campaigns to raise awareness of Canadian public on global MNCH issues. This initiative is expected to contribute directly to the improved health of approximately 1 million women, more than 900,000 children under five years of age, and over 200,000 adolescent girls, as well as over 1.1 million men with improved MNCH services. An estimated 1.8 million individuals are expected to benefit from the initiative's results indirectly. In addition, activities targeting Canadian awareness of MNCH are expected to reach over 700,000 Canadians.Plan International Canada is implementing this project in partnership with Promundo and the Hospit\",\n",

The prevalence rate has remained stable and below 5% over the past 16 years. The current national prevalence is 1.9% and prevalence among pregnant women is 2.6% (2007 sentinel surveillance report: National AIDS Control Program/Ghana Health Services).This Program addresses gaps in the national response such as 1) superficial understanding of HIV in many segments of the population including youth, and an inability to move people from general knowledge and awareness of risk to actually adopting safer behaviors; 2) insufficient targeting of MARPs and vulnerable groups; 3) slow integration of HIV/AIDS and Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH); 4) shortfalls in institutional and community capacities to rapidly scale-up comprehensive HIV services.Recognizing that clients of MARPs serve as a bridge between MARPs and general population in HIV transmission, this Program targets MARPs, vulnerable groups and general population. As part of health system strengthening measures directly related to HIV services, this Program targets blood safety, prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), early infant diagnosis, and integration of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) services.As a part of the strengthening national health system in its response to HIV epidemic and emphasizing the need of stronger partnerships between the public health sector, civil society and the private sector, this Program will be implemented by multiple Principal Recipients, as of the effective date of this Agreement, the Ministry of Health/Ghana Health Services, Ghana AIDS Commission (the Principal Recipient), Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana, Adventist Development and Relief Agency of Ghana. 2.Goal:  To reduce new HIV infections in the general population.Target Group/Beneficiaries:�People living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV);�MARPs: MSM and their female partners, FSWs, Prison inmates, most-at-risk youth (15-24), Workers (miners, uniformed services, transport workers);�Vulnerable groups: young people (aged 15-24), female porters;�Pregnant women;�Infants born to HIV-positive pregnant women; and�General population4.Strategies:�To promote the adoption of safer sexual practices in the general population;�To promote healthy behaviors and the adoption of safer sexual practices among PLHIV, MARPs and vulnerable groups; �To promote the integration of SRH and HIV/AIDS services with emphasis on PMTCT and safe blood transfusions; and�To strengthen the institutional capacity and community systems for scaling-up HIV/AIDS, STI a',\n",

Background and Summary:  The primary goal of this Program is to reinforce the Government of Tanzania's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by expanding service delivery to the lower tiers of the health system. Attaining this goal requires financing recurring costs, such as Health Products and consumables, as well as supporting activities that maintain and strengthen the system in place, such as refresher training for community health workers, supervision and mentoring. Experience with previous Global Fund grants has highlighted the need for greater coordination among relevant stakeholders. Accordingly, this grant will support the scale up of HIV/AIDS services by strengthening capacity and coordination among key stakeholders in the public and private sectors, including: Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), Faith-based Organizations (FBOs), People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) groups, as well as the Tanzania Commission for AIDS (TACAIDS), the national coordination body for Tanzania's multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS programming.  Tanzania faces an urgent need for drugs and commodities for the delivery of HIV/AIDS services. The scale-up of the national anti-retroviral therapy (ART) program has resulted in a seven-fold increase in the number of patients enrolled in treatment, from 23,951 in 2005 to 189,494 in October 2008. Funding for commodities that are key to the delivery of key services such as HIV testing, Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) management, Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT), ART, Opportunistic Infection (OI) treatment and prophylaxis, and early infant diagnosis will therefore form an integral part of the Program. The Program will additionally measure the outputs, outcomes and impact of HIV/AIDS interventions addressed by the Program. Specifically, this program's main objectives are to scale up through expansion of care and treatment services to primary health care facilities, increase coverage of key prevention services all over the country, ensure continuous quality service delivery and strengthen the national-level stakeholders and coordination mechanisms.  Two Principal Recipients will work on attaining the goals of the program, namely the Ministry of Finance and African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF). 2.

Despite all the efforts that have been made in the field of tuberculosis control in Mozambique, one of the biggest challenges in combating this rapidly spreading disease is to increase the TB detection rate. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of a simple, fast and accurate diagnostic method. Due to this alarming situation, the Mozambican government has declared this epidemic to be a national emergency and for this reason drafted a National Strategic Plan 2008-2012. In 2011, the Mozambican government wants to raise the detection rate from 53% to 58% and substantially increase the recovery rate and the number of TB patients that is tested for HIV/AIDS.  With an eye to finding a solution to this pressing problem of TB diagnosis in countries with limited resources and infrastructure, Apopo has started exploring the possibility of using African HeroRATs to detect tuberculosis. By implementing its unique TB detection technology Apopo aims:(1) to contribute to the national TB control programme of Mozambique by effectively increasing the number of detected TB patients in the short term;(2) to build a local capacity of TB detection rats and trainers to also have a continued long-term impact on the reduction of the TB problem in Mozambique.  Expected outcome: (1) delivery of support to the national TB-program of Mozambique in the short run by effectively increased numbers of treated TB-patients;(2) increased capacity of trainers and rodents for TB-detection in the country.

They will integrate underlying factors that influence nutritional outcomes including water, sanitation, and hygiene practices. The project builds on previous research testing homestead food production with vegetable gardens in combination with fish ponds to grow nutrient-dense small fish for household consumption and large fish for sale. The earlier research found that nutritional quality was enhanced, incomes improved, and women had a greater role in household decision-making.

ESTABLISHING A HARMONIZED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH REGISTRY IN JORDAN TO IMPROVE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH. This project seeks to improve the quality and timely collection and use of reproductive health data in the Mafraq governorate of Jordan by establishing a harmonized Reproductive Health Registry (hRHR). The dearth and lack of reliable data limits the ability to make informed decisions by health providers, planners and community members, which can influence the well-being of women and children. The proposed implementation research project involving the participatory development of an electronic harmonized reproductive health registry is expected to link timely and accurate health data from local primary care health centres to hospital settings and governorate-level planning bodies, and back to communities. Issues of expanding services to cover vulnerable and undercounted populations are central to the proposed implementation and related research activities. Given the high numbers of Syrian refugees in the Mafraq governorate, the registry will be designed to serve both refugee and non-refugee populations to address different health needs and social contexts of the various groups. The project will also focus on strengthening the capacities of decision-makers at different levels of the health system and other sectors to use the data collected and analyzed through the registry. The project will apply mixed methods to conduct a situational analysis of existing systems and tools of sexual and reproductive health data collection and use; develop a harmonized electronic registry system using participatory approaches and established guidelines from the World Health Organization; strengthen representation of underserved groups of women, men and youth in stakeholder meetings and governance processes; develop a dashboard of data and related analysis; assess the quality, timeliness and reliability of data; and build capacities of researchers and decision-makers. The main outcomes include improved quality and timeliness of reproductive health data, better integration and interoperability among different health facilities, a strengthened referral system, increased capacities by decision-makers and providers to use health data, and costed plans to scale up the hRHR effort to other parts of the country.  This proposal represents one of nine selected as a cohort of implementation research projects spanning two regions (West Africa and the Middle East) and two thematic topics (adolescent sexual and reproductive health and health information systems).

ADDRESSING THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF LEISHMANIASIS IN THE BORDERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, AND PARAGUAY. Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector - borne diseases worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe visceral form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans. This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease ' s emergence and spread in the bordering area through multi - country collaboration. The project squad will develop evidence - based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio - cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will: - analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re - emergence of leishmaniasis; - assess how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries; - identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth - based prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision - makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and, - improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three countries by strengthening cross - country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange. In the area under study, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements ), and tourists. Researchers will study biological, environmental, and societal variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease ' s emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision - makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities ' explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Participants will include decision - makers from the local, subnational, and national levels of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan - American Health Organization. This will enhance uptake of results and implementation of multi - sector prevention and control strategies. It will also help ensure that results are replicated and scaled up in other high - risk areas of the sub - region. The work is expected to set the foundation for novel control strategies and programs in the three countries and inform possible regional responses.\",\n",

FUNCTION OF IMMUNE cellular phone POPULATIONS IN HYPOPIGMENTATION DISORDERS OF AUTOIMMUNE AND INFECTIOUS ORIGIN. Why do citizens pay taxes? This question is surprisingly underexplored. Understanding when citizens pay taxes and wherefore they find it relevant and purposeful is central for answer this question. Tax compliance is a major concern in developing countries and particularly in Sub - Saharan Africa, in order to reduce dependency of foreign aid and increase state revenues for providing adequate health, educational and infrastructural services for their populations. In a nutshell, taxes are needed to build capable states that can provide for their citizens. Remarkably, taxation has not figured centrally on the agenda among scholars working on statebuilding in Africa or the African voter. Determinants of willingness to pay taxes in developing countries need to be scrutinized using an insiders ' perspective of what it means to be a tax payer on an everyday basis across different socioeconomic groups. This project expands on current explanations through focusing on the social practice of taxes; when, how and where taxation occurs and how this practice forms part of the everyday for ordinary citizens. This is studied through an ethnographic study of the practices surrounding tax payment in three cases in Sub - Saharan Africa (Lesotho, Tanzania and Zambia ), where the willingness to pay taxes and the relative tax burden vary. A comparative micro - study of citizens ' experience with taxes, using interviews and observations, will reveal the room for building a tax paying culture.\",\n",

This include studies to elucidate immune mechanisms and antigens of importance for protection against diseases caused by these bacteria and to construct and evaluate promising candidate vaccines for safety and immunogenicity, initially in animals and subsequently in humans. It also includes a search for new ETEC colonization factors and analyses of emerging ETEC clones by means of whole genome sequencing. A new oral ETEC candidate vaccine developed by us, consisting of recombinant E. coli bacteria over - expressing the most important ETEC colonization factors and a anatoxin will be evaluated alone and together with a promising mucosal adjuvant for safety and immunogenicity in Phase I / II studies, initially in Sweden and subsequently in descending age groups in Bangladesh. The aim is also to identify simple interventions such as calorie and micronutrient supplementation, changed breast feeding patterns, anti - parasite treatment that may improve immune responses against enteric vaccines in children in developing countries.

ADDRESSING THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF LEISHMANIASIS IN THE BORDERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, AND PARAGUAY. Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector - borne diseases worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe visceral form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans. This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease ' s emergence and spread in the bordering regions through multi - country collaboration. The project team will develop evidence - based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio - cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will: - analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the egress or re - emergence of leishmaniasis; - assess how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries; - identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth - based prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision - makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and, - improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategy in the three countries by strengthening cross - country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange. In the area under study, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements ), and tourists. Researchers will study biological, environmental, and social variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each rural area, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease ' s emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision - makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities ' explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Participants will include decision - makers from the local, subnational, and national levels of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan - American Health Organization. This will enhance uptake of results and implementation of multi - sector prevention and control strategies. It will also help ensure that results are replicated and scaled up in other high - risk areas of the sub - region. The work is expected to set the foundation for novel control strategies and programs in the three countries and inform possible regional responses.\",\n",

In an era of dwindling support from governments and foundations, many university have, in turn, begun to solicit funds from businesses. In the case of schools of public health, some potential corporate funders make products that may be considered harmful to health or a threat to the environment, creating a potential conflict of interest.

At present, there are no generalized guidelines to govern the receipt of research and sponsorship funds from for - profit corporations - practices differ by schools and programs of public health. This project, managed by the American University of Beirut, will survey public health academics and practitioners around the world about their attitudes and practices around funding from for - profit corporations, particularly those whose products are associated with non - communicable diseases.

These statistics provide policymakers and practitioners with the necessary evidence to design interventions and enact appropriate policies on maternal and child health. Many low - and center - income countries, however, do not systematically collect such crucial information. It is estimated that one - third of the world ' s births and two - thirds of the world ' s deaths are not registered or are incorrectly certified.

The aim of this collaborative research project is to examine the role of antigen diversity on the antibody response and acquired immunity against clinical episodes of malaria; with the overall purpose of identifying candidate antigens to be included in a multi - component malaria vaccine. The project will describe parasite diversity in relation to antibody responses and protective immunity in individuals with different degree of exposure within defined geographical regions in Ghana and Kenya, as well as in travellers experiencing first time infections. We will focus on a subset of antigens (n = 10) that have been shown to be potential targets of protective immunity and include both conserved and polymorphic proteins. We will sequence the sponger collected from the community to define precisely the diversity at the selected loci, express these antigens and then analyse the antibody responses to conserve and diverse antigens. We will specifically investigate compounding of antigens and variants of antigens to which antibodies confer protection. The project will use samples that are and have been collected within longitudinal well - established cohorts in Ghana and Kenya, as well as Swedish travelers.

Health is suit a core feature of global negotiations, whether they relate to trade, economic growth, or social development. New research will help boost Africa ' s bargaining power in global health diplomacy, The term global health diplomacy has been coined to describe the multidisciplinary work related to diplomacy, public policy, and global health. But an underlying North - South divide exists in this area, leaving Africa - and sub - Saharan Africa in particular - at a disadvantage. Although the region is highly integrated in the global economy, it has little bargaining power in such high - level negotiations. In health, for example, this has consequences when global level agreements and negotiations limit the space for national policy decisions on the development and strengthening of equitable health systems. This research aims to examine and communicate the most important elements countries need to assert their public health interests in global wellness diplomacy from an African perspective. The research will look at three examples of global health diplomacy important to sub - Saharan Africa: 1) the implementation of the World Health Organization ' s Code on International Recruitment of Health Personnel; 2) new collaboration on access to essential drugs through South - South relationships involving Africa, China, Brazil, and India; and 3) the involvement of African actors in getting universal access to prevention, treatment, and care for HIV and AIDS.

ADDRESSING THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF LEISHMANIASIS IN THE BORDERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, AND PARAGUAY. Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector - borne diseases worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe visceral form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans. This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease ' s emergence and spread in the bordering regions through multi - country collaboration. The project team will develop evidence - based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio - cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will: - analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re - emergence of leishmaniasis; - assess how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries; - identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth - based prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision - makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and, - improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three country by strengthening cross - country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange. In the area under study, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements ), and tourists. Researchers will study biological, environmental, and social variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease ' s emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision - makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities ' explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Player will include decision - makers from the local, subnational, and national levels of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan - American Health Organization. This will enhance uptake of results and implementation of multi - sector prevention and control strategies. It will also help ensure that results are replicated and scaled up in other high - risk area of the sub - region. The work is expected to set the foundation for novel control strategies and programs in the three countries and inform possible regional responses.\",\n",

We have previously been deeply involved in the development of the internationally available, closely related oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) Dukoral � and Shanchol �. These vaccines are effective, but the use of several strains and two inactivation methods makes their manufacture complex and relatively expensive, and OCVs are therefore still severely underused globally. In developing a new generation of OCVs, a central aim is to make it affordable for the populations in greatest need. This can be achieved by simplifying manufacture whilst maintaining the levels of protection afforded by currently available OCVs. Using a single vaccine strain and one inactivation method would considerably simplify and reduce the cost of manufacture. We have recently developed a novel concept and also engineered a new type of vaccine strains for such a new generation of OCVs, whereby the several V. cholerae O1 components in Dukoral and Shanchol can be replaced by a single - mental strain / single - formulation component with full retention of protective immunogenicity. We now propose, in collaboration with partners in India and Bangladesh, (1) to develop this novel single - strain OCV prototype combined with recombinantly produced cholera toxin B subunit into a truly low - cost, and also thermo - and pH - stable vaccine formulation for worldwide use including stockpiling purposes. A first - generation of the new OCV is planned to go into clinical testing in Bangladesh in early 2017 with product approval hoped for already in 2018 / 19. In parallel, (2) we will also develop a second - generation OCV formulation, which by including a novel cholera - toxin - derived mucosal adjuvant may provide adequate protection after single - dose administration, a feature which would be especially valuable for use in cholera outbreaks. The projected novel, low - cost, thermo - and pH - stable vaccine can be produced at a fraction of the cost of current vaccines, and should equal attractive for worldwide use including stockpiling purposes.

VECTOR CONTROL BY MULTIPLE CLASSES OF SMALL ORGANIC COMPOUNDS TO COMBAT MOSQUITO - BORNE INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND SUPPRESS INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE. Insect vectors transmit numerous viral - and parasite infections between humans or from animals to humans. Worst affected are poor people living in vulnerable communities in tropical and sub - tropical regions. Vector control by insecticides is the dominant way to combat and prevent transmission of mosquito - borne diseases. Due to globalization, environmental changes and increased insecticide resistance, there is an urgent need for new approaches and strategies for efficient vector control. This proposal aims to design, synthesize and develop multiple novel chemical classes of insecticides for control of Aedes aegypti (transmits e. g. dengue and chikungunya) and Anopheles gambiae (transmits malaria ). We will target a form of acetylcholinesterase (AChE1) not present in vertebrates, and identify diverse selective chemical starting points by high throughput screening (HTS ). Evaluation of a performed HTS targeting mosquito AChE1 has shown promising results. We have identified several classes of substances that are selective for the mosquito - form over human AChE. These multiple chemical starting points will be synthetically explored and optimized into insect powder. Early on in the discovery process we will include, in addition to the target - specific endpoints, response estimates that address human safety, environmental fate and effect, resistance sensitivity, and cost of goods.

ADDRESSING THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF LEISHMANIASIS IN THE BORDERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, AND PARAGUAY. Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector - borne diseases worldwide, with more than deuce million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe visceral form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans. This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease ' s emergence and spread in the bordering regions through multi - country collaboration. The project team will develop evidence - based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio - cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will: - analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re - emergence of leishmaniasis; - assess how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries; - identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth - based prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision - makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and, - improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three countries by strengthening cross - country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange. In the area under study, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements ), and tourists. Researchers will study biological, environmental, and social variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease ' s emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision - makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities ' explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Participants will include decision - makers from the local, subnational, and national levels of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan - American Health Organization.

These statistics provide policymakers and practitioners with the necessary evidence to design interventions and enact appropriate policies on maternal and child health. Many low - and middle - income countries, however, do not systematically collect such all important information. It is estimated that one - third of the world ' s births and two - thirds of the world ' s deaths are not registered or are incorrectly certified. In many cases, global average, standards, tools, and good practices are non readily accessible and useable to those who need them most. The project will establish the Centre of Excellence for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Systems to provide information, tools, and expertise to facilitate the development and implementation of integrated CRVS systems. Funded by Global Affairs Canada and the International Development Research Middle (IDRC ), and based at IDRC, the Centre of Excellence will coordinate with existing expert groups to generate, consolidate, and share information and resources in an open and collaborative electronic platform. It will also assist countries needing more direct support by facilitating the exchange of good practices and capacity strengthening, and will play an important role brokering technical assistance for countries needing more direct support. The Centre of Excellence will work closely with the Global Financing Facility in support of the Every Woman Every Child initiative to enable the development and implementation of CRVS systems plans as part of country - led investment cases for financing by the Global Financing Facility.\",\n",

LINKING EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES RESEARCH AND POLICY NETWORKS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND CHINA: APEIR PHASE II. The Asian Partnership on Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (APEIR) is a multi - country, multi - disciplinary and multi - sectoral research network that enables researchers and experts from several sectors, including agriculture and health, to explore joint research and policy questions in animal and public health. The partnership uses an ecohealth approach to address the complexity of emerging infectious diseases. This project presents a new phase of APEIR research on emerging threats from antimicrobial resistance and wildlife trade. It aims to strengthen the field of ecohealth and enhance emerging infectious disease control in Asia through research, capacity building, social and policy advocacy, and stronger knowledge and response networks. The wide use and abuse of antimicrobials as anti - infective drugs and non - therapeutic treatments are key contributors to persistent infections caused by resistance to antimicrobials. This use and abuse is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. In China and Southeast Asia, the lack of policy or regulation enforcements means that the use of antibiotics is not well - controlled. This research will provide evidence and guidance to make grow country - specific and regional strategies to improve the responsible use of antibiotics and to reduce the emergence of resistant infectious agents in China, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. Southeast Asia ' s thriving wildlife trade supports disease transmission to humans. It also threatens livestock, international trade, rural livelihoods, native wildlife populations, and ecosystem health. Little is known about the zoonotic disease risks involved in transmitting diseases between brute and humans. This study will assess the pathogens that circulate and will explore possible pathways of transmission to humans, specifically in China, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. It will help prevent emerging zoonotic infectious diseases. It will also decrease wildlife consumption, while educating people about the safe and wise use of wildlife as a source of food protein for poor people. Finally, it will support wildlife diversity and mitigate illegal wildlife trade in the region. Building on past research on avian influenza and ongoing knowledge - translation activities in the health field, this new phase of work will help APEIR build and support regional capacity to communicate and share knowledge to promptly address emerging infectious disease threats.\",\n",

ACQUIRED IMMUNITY TO MALARIA: IMPORTANCE OF THE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM. Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is a potentially fatal infection. Understanding how the extensive genetic polymorphism of the parasite affects the acquisition and maintenance of immunity is a prerequisite for the development of efficacious control tools such as vaccines. In our previous studies, we have shown that persistent asymptomatic multiclonal infections predict a reduced risk of disease in high transmission settings. The aim of this project is to further establish how the hereditary diversity of P. falciparum infection affects protective immunity to malaria. We will investigate polymorphisms in P. falciparum antigen genes, i. e. genes under immune selection, in person with different levels of exposure and immunity both within and between geographical areas, and identify potential? hotspots? of transmission. The genetic diversity of P. falciparum infections will be related to the breadth and magnitude of antibody responses directed to a panel of several P. falciparum antigens. The longevity of immune responses (antimalarial antibody and memory B cell responses) will be studied. The project includes well defined and closely monitored cohorts living in areas of different transmission in Kenya, Tanzania and Mali, as well as Swedish traveller who experience malaria for the first time. The project will contribute to the understanding of the molecular epidemiology of P. falciparum and the acquisition and maintenance of protective immunity against malaria.',\n",

Dengue fever and chikungunyaIn Colombia and Venezuela, research and governmental institutions from the Latin American Ecohealth Leadership Consortium on Vector - borne Diseases have decreased Aedes mosquito populations significantly through municipal interventions. This mosquito is responsible for transmitting two viral diseases: dengue fever and chikungunya. Dengue and chikungunya interventions bequeath be scaled up in three affected municipalities. Both diseases are responsible for rapidly growing health and economic burdens in the two countries. The project is expect to generate new knowledge on factors affecting policy adoption and scaling up: - institutional capacity gaps - early involvement and leadership of municipal players - good governance - costs - validating impact on disease incidenceThe evidence should help researchers and governments replicate the project at a larger scale.

Rotavirus is the major cause for severe childhood diarrhea, thus rotavirus vaccines are an important preventive measure of diarrhea. Vaccine trials have, however, showed a reduced vaccine efficacy in many African countries. Burkina Faso is now about to implement vaccination nationwide and our research proposal is centered on this. By closely monitoring rotavirus before; during and after national immunization, we can investigate factors important for vaccine efficacy. A first objective embody to establish RV surveillance logistics and techniques before vaccination. We have performed preliminary studies and found many unusual strains which could influence vaccine efficacy. The major objective is to determine the vaccine efficacy and relate this to evolving escape mutants and specific strains present in Burkina Faso. Our third scientific approach is most novel and based on preliminary data from Burkina Faso observing that children with the Lewis - negative phenotype, common in Burkina Faso, where not infected with vaccine - like strains, providing an explanation for reduced vaccine efficacy in Africa.

Corporations have sought to engage with universities to support and augment their research and training activities. In an era of dwindling support for research and practice from governments and foundation, many universities have in turn begun to solicit funds from businesses. However, in the case of schools of public health, a number of corporations sought as potential funders make products that may be considered harmful to health operating theatre a threat to the environment - creating a potential conflict of interest. Among public health institutions there are no generalized guidelines to govern the receipt of research and sponsorship funds from for - profit corporations. Practices differ by schools and programs of public health.

ADDRESSING THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF LEISHMANIASIS IN THE BORDERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, AND PARAGUAY. Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector - borne diseases worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe visceral form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay take the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans. This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease ' s emergence and spread in the bordering regions through multi - country collaboration. The project team will develop evidence - based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio - cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will: - analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re - emergence of leishmaniasis; - tax how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries; - identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth - based prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision - makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and, - improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three countries by strengthening cross - country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange. In the area under study, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements ), and tourists. Researchers will study biological, environmental, and social variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease ' s emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision - makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities ' explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Participants will include decision - makers from the local, subnational, and national levels of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan - American Health Organization. This will enhance uptake of results and implementation of multi - sector prevention and control strategies. It will also help ensure that results are replicated and scaled up in other high - risk areas of the sub - region. The piece of work is expected to set the foundation for novel control strategies and programs in the three countries and inform possible regional responses.\",\n",

USING NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES (NGS) TO FIND Deoxyadenosine monophosphate CURE FOR HUMAN AND CATTLE FILARIASIS. . Lymphatic filariasis is the 2nd most common cause of permanent and long term disability in the world. In Sri Lanka approximately 50% of the population (9. 8 million people) is at risk of contracting bancroftian filariasis. Permanent and long term disability as well as acute attacks of filariasis affects the productivity of persons and causes loss of income. Currently no vaccinum is available for human filarisis. There are only two drugs available for treating human lymphatic filariasis: The worm Wuchereria bancrofti is responsible for approximately 115 million cases and approximately 13 million is caused by Brugia malayi. Although W. bancrofti is the major causative organism, very little is known about the molecular biology, biochemistry and immune mechanisms of this parasite. W. bancrofti cannot be maintained in the laboratory and this is an impediment for testing new treatment forms in laboratory conditions. The project described in this proposal proposes the use of a cattle filarial parasite, Setaria digitata, as the model organism. This project will sequence and annotate the complete genome of Setaria digitata using NGS tecnologies. Work that will allow the identification of genes susceptible to drugs.

Registration of events, such as birth, death, causes of death, marriage, and divorce, is critical for improving maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health. These statistics provide policymakers and practitioners with the necessary evidence to design interventions and enact appropriate policies on maternal and child health. Many low - and middle - income countries, however, do not systematically collect such crucial information. It is estimated that one - third of the world ' s births and two - thirds of the world ' s deaths are not registered or are incorrectly certified. In many cases, global norms, standards, tools, and good practices are not readily accessible and useable to those who need them most. The project will establish the Centre of Excellence for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Systems to provide information, tools, and expertise to facilitate the development and implementation of integrated CRVS systems. Funded by Global Affairs Canada and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC ), and based at IDRC, the Centre of Excellence will coordinate with existing expert groups to generate, consolidate, and plowshare information and resources in an open and collaborative electronic platform. It will also assist countries needing more direct support by facilitating the exchange of good practices and capacity strengthening, and will play an important role brokering technical assistance for countries needing more direct support. The Centre of Excellence will work closely with the Global Financing Facility in support of the Every Woman Every Child initiative to enable the development and implementation of CRVS systems plans as part of country - led investment cases for financing by the Global Financing Facility.\",\n",

Canada ' s international response to the HIV / AIDS epidemic is largely built around the work of the Canadian HIV Vaccine Initiative (CHVI ). CHVI proposes to increase the capacity of Canada and low - and middle - income countries to respond to the HIV / AIDS pandemic by developing new HIV vaccines and other preventive approaches; investigating social and policy issues related to HIV / AIDS; conducting clinical trials; and building an HIV vaccine manufacturing facility in Canada. The third component, conducting clinical trials, requires the participation of enquiry institutions from around the world, including those operating in high HIV - prevalence countries. However, such institutions - especially those in Africa - often lack the necessary research capacity to fully engage in clinical trials. In order to address this challenge, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has allocated CA $ 6 million to the Global Health Research Initiative (GHRI) to support building African capacity for clinical trials.

NOVEL PROTEIN MICROARRAY TECHNOLOGIES FOR AFFORDABLE AND RAPID HIGH PERFORMANCE POINT OF CARE DIAGNOSTICS OF SEVERE INFECTIONS IN LOW - INCOME SETTINGS. Infectious diseases is the major grounds of death in low - income countries, especially in Sub - Saharan Africa. Rapid tests for Malaria and HIV have in late years dramatically improved management of patients and are extremely useful where there is no access to laboratories and qualified staff. However, today no rapid tests are available for many of the most serious infectious diseases such as TB and pneumonia, and further the sheer number of rapid tests is becoming untenable financially and practically. We will employ protein microarray technology to allow simultaneous detection of a patient ' s antibody - response to a variety of pathogens, where each pathogen ' s unique antibody signature allows greatly improved specificity. Our group has recently developed novel microarray formats that through use of certain nitrocellulose substrates and novel nanoparticle - based amplification strategies allow retained accuracy as compared with lab - base assays within 10 minutes of analysis at a fraction of the cost. The main focus of the project is to create a rapid test for reliable determination of active / latent TB in pediatric patients and at the same time detect signatures of a number of other relevant viral, bacterial and parasitic infections. The method development will be done at the Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm, whereas the field testing will be done in collaboration with partners at the Mbarara hospital in Uganda and the division of Global Health at the Karolinska Institute.\",\n",

CLINICAL FIELD STUDIES FOR POINT - OF - CARE DIAGNOSTICS USING MINIATURE MICROSCOPY SCANNERS. We have developed a low - cost miniaturized microscopy scanner that digitizes patient samples at high magnification and transfers the generated virtual slides over mobile networks. Our central server receives the virtual slides and allows the biological samples to be remotely analyzed by automated computer vision or visually assessed by a human observer. A proof - of - concept study supported by the Swedish Research Council has been conducted in 2014 - 2015 and shown the method to be feasible. We now plan to implement the novel multipurpose diagnostic platform in two settings in United republic of tanzania: 1) As a diagnostic method for detection of malaria in blood samples obtained from patients presenting with fever at the primary health care level and 2) as a diagnostic and monitoring method for detection of soil - transmitted helminthes and schistosomiasis in stool and urine obtained from schoolchildren within a transmission surveillance sight. Captured digital images of the specimens are transferred to the central server to detect malaria parasites in blood smears, and helminth eggs in stool and urine, and to return the results to the technician in the field. The point - of - care study will be carried out in the Bagamoyo District and the transmission surveillance study in the Masasi / Muheza District in Tanzania in collaboration with Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS ). The study will include a comparison with conventional microscopy with regard to diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value ), an evaluation of usability, interpretability and assessment of time to achieve diagnosis. The project advances the field by bringing a powerful, multiplexed diagnostic tool from the laboratory to the point - of - care. The instruments are constructed out of components of mobile phones, make use of the expanding mobile networks and allow remote image processing in a highly scalable cloud computing environment. Previous mobile microscopy projects have been limited with regard to the sample area that can be captured, whereas the technology to be tested in the current project can digitally scan an entire microscopy slide. The method will aid in the combat of infectious diseases at the point - of - care level of health care and has the potential to improve access to diagnostics, enable task - shifting and shorten the time to diagnosis.',\n",

ADDRESSING THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF LEISHMANIASIS IN THE BORDERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, AND PARAGUAY. Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector - borne diseases worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe splanchnic form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans. This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease ' s emergence and spread in the bordering regions through multi - country collaboration. The project team will develop evidence - based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio - cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will: - analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re - emergence of leishmaniasis; - assess how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries; - identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth - establish prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision - makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and, - improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three countries by strengthening cross - country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange. In the area under discipline, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements ), and tourists. Researchers will study biological, environmental, and social variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease ' s emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision - makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities ' explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Participants will include decision - makers from the local, subnational, and national level of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan - American Health Organization. This will enhance uptake of results and implementation of multi - sector prevention and control strategies. It will also help ensure that results are replicated and scale up in other high - risk areas of the sub - region. The work is expected to set the foundation for novel control strategies and programs in the three countries and inform possible regional responses.\",\n",

       "  \"13040. Expanding HIV/AIDS Prevention in Bangladesh. EXPANDING HIV/AIDS PREVENTION IN BANGLADESH. The most important achievement of the grant has been its contribution to the low-prevalence of HIV in Bangladesh. Many countries experienced explosive increase of HIV from the epidemic of Injecting Drug Users (IDU). To a large degree, due to the activities supported by the grant this did not occur in Bangladesh. IDUs and Female Sex Workers (FSWs) are the focus of the grant. At the end of Phase 1 of the RCC Grant (December 2011), the performance of the grant against its targets was considered satisfactory. The average performance on the Top 10 indicators was 96% (A2). All indicators rating was at 98% (A2). Out of 14 Service Delivery Area indicators, 6 were overachieved, 5 were between 90-100%; two indicators were slightly below 90% and one - 'Number of IDU and FSW reached through Peer Education' - was at 68% and rapidly catching up from the previous level of 50%. The underachievement was partially due to the discontinuation of a Sub-Recipient (SR) agreement in September 2011 with an entity that was ensuring the coverage of up to one-third of IDU targets. The discontinuation of this SR agreement followed an investigation by the Global Fund's Office of the Inspector General which found disturbing signs of fraudulent practices by the SR. The PR acted decisively in order to safeguard the Global Fund money and took over the direct implementation of IDU-related activities. As a result, the PR managed to maintain the expected return of the grant by avoiding the prolonged discontinuation of preventive activities for IDUs, while at the same time reducing further risk.Overall, it is expected that a good level of performance will be maintained throughout the time remaining until the end of Phase 1 (in November 30, 2012) and, pending the Phase 2 approval, beyond Phase 1.'---1. Background and Summary:  With estimated HIV prevalence of less than 0.1% (2009 UNAIDS Country Brief), Bangladesh is a low HIV prevalence country. UNAIDS estimates about 12,000 people in Bangladesh to be living with HIV at the end of 2007. As of December 2008, a total of 1495 cases of HIV infection were confirmed, with 476 of them developing AIDS and 165 reported death cases (National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan). The Sero Surveillance Report findings show that HIV infection rate is increasing among most-at-risk-population (MARP), particularly among injecting drug users (IDUs) with concentrated epidemic in Dhaka (7%), and among female sex workers (FSW) due to low level of condom use.Despite the low HIV prevalence in Bangladesh, several risk factors, including geographical location, high population mobility, a large number of migrant workers, poverty, and low level of awareness among young people threaten to hamper the continuing status of Bangladesh as a low HIV prevalence country. The HIV Joint Monitoring Mission organized by the World Bank and its key partners in February 2009 found that prompt and vigorous action is needed to strengthen the quality and coverage of HIV prevention programs,\",\n",

Background:  Brief overview of the FA collaboration during the past5 -year period (FA3). During the past 5 -year period, the FA institutional collaboration between ITM and LRM has improved LRM capacity in several domains:  -  -LRM has recently been designated as a supranational reference laboratory candidate for TB by the WHO and serves as a center of excellence for other countries in the West/ Central African Region  - LRM has established a well -functioning lab network for BU diagnosis with a specific manual available, conducts regular supervisions of peripheral labs, and completes external quality controls showing excellent results. This can serve as an example for other countries in the region  - Several PhDs have been defended by students from LRM and an increasing number of research articles are authored by LRM staff  Previous institutional collaborations between LRM and ITM were under FA1 (1998 -2002), FA2 (2003 -2007), FA3 -I (2008 -2010) and FA3 -II (2010 to 2013). Below are reports for the past 5 -year period: Progress 2012 A well -functioning lab network for BU diagnosis is now in place in Benin with a specific manual available, regular supervisions of peripheral labs and external quality controls showing excellent results.  LRM has also set up qPCR for BU diagnosis and a second study has been performed to compare it with classical PCR, which showed an increase in positivity rate of 33%. This technique has now been adopted at LRM and is routinely used on samples received from BU centres. However, new changes on the probe used for this technology suggest further improvements of the performance of this test are possible. Though it was not possible to establish formal links between LRM and labs from other countries, some lab technicians have been received from these countries for training. In addition, samples from BU suspected cases from neighbouring countries are received at LRM, and analysed with the different tests available. Finally, the differential diagnosis study is ongoing with more than 100 patients recruited to date.  Progress 2011 Activities to maintain a well -established laboratory for BU diagnosis in West -Africa as well as a good national microscopy network have been maintained and strengthened: National guidelines for the BU microscopy network have been validated and printed. The equipment for real time PCR has been provided to LRM by ITM, LRM staff has been trained on this technique which has been set up and is now routinely used in this laboratory. Samples from field centers (patients from Benin as well as from neighbouring countries) have been tested for BU diagnosis and peripheral laboratories were regularly supervised and controlled. In terms of research activities in 2011, two researchers from DRC have been received at LRM for joint training on immunological tests on BU.

The school feeding system in China provides 180 to 200 days of meals a year to rural children from economically disadvantaged provinces that have a high incidence of malnutrition. The program covers 14 provinces, 100 counties, and over three million children. In order to make policy adjustments and expand the benefits to other low-income areas of the country, it is essential to measure the impact of the system. The purpose of this study is to assess China's school feeding system under its National Nutrition Improvement Plan to better understand the system's impact on rural students, local food security, and sustainable economic growth. Researchers will assess the quality of the meals and nutrient intake by children aged seven to 15 in relation to their health and nutritional status, school attendance, and educational outcomes. Economic impact on local communities will be monitored to understand if and how the system affects local food production, procurement, and employment, particularly for women. To improve the potential impacts of the system on nutritional outcomes, additional interventions (including nutrition education and capacity development for women and men) will be introduced in a selected number of schools over a period of two years, and their impact will be evaluated.     The project will be led by the China Development Research Foundation (CDRF) in collaboration with several strategic participating institutions, including the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Food Program, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture, Microsoft, Amway Charity Foundation, and the Capital Healthcare and Nutrition Cuisine Society.

IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF A SMARTPHONE TELECONSULTATION SYSTEM FOR ACUTE BURN INJURY CARE IN RESOURCE-POOR SETTINGS. Burn injuries are a leading cause of premature death worldwide and are largely attributable to poor living conditions. Timely care is a prerequisite to reduce morbidity and mortality and it can be significantly improved in resource-poor settings by teleconsultation systems to support the provision of appropriate and timely care.A teleconsultation system for acute burn care is currently under implementation in the Western Cape, South Africa. An application (app) is installed on a smartphone located in each of the emergency services of 8 hospitals to transmit visual and textual information between emergency staff at point of care and a network of burn teleexperts. The burns specialist on call is informed via instant messaging that a case has been uploaded and can then review the visually transmitted information and images and provide diagnostic and treatment advice. The primary aim of the project is to assess how a teleconsultation system for acute burn injury care based on a smartphone application can impact on the delivery of emergency care for burns victims, both in terms of clinical management and site of care. Intermediate aims are to assess the clinical quality, clinical outcomes, user perspective, and costs and benefits of the teleconsultation system. The clinical quality will include assessments of diagnostic accuracy and patient management. Bedside diagnosis or image based diagnosis by burns experts will be used as gold standard. A historical cohort design will be used to assess the effect of the teleconsultation system on patient outcomes. The Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Model will be used to assess how the users experience the system and the system's cost-utility will be assessed in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. A stepwise implementation of the system is planned in Tanzania and Ethiopia starting the beginning of 2016. The burn specialists already involved in South Africa will act as experts for the two additional countries and the existing south-south network of emergency specialists will safeguard the communication and implementation of the system. This proposal will build on the evaluation already started in South Africa and will allow a more robust and comprehensive evaluation of the whole system. Furthermore, the inclusion of other settings will add important contextual aspects to the evaluation. The first part of the evaluation will include the hospitals currently using the teleconsultation system in the Western Cape, South Africa and 2-3 hospitals where the system will be introduced in Tanzania. Later on, 2-3 hospitals in Ethiopia will be introduced to the system, informed by the process in Tanzania, and those hospitals will be included in the evaluation.Low cost and timely alternatives to burn injury control are a pressing need in many low- and middle-income settings and countries.

RENOVATION OF THE HEALTH CENTRE AND FIRE STATION BUILDINGS IN THE VILLAGE OF VIDOVICE IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA WHICH WERE DAMAGED BY FLOODING. During the 2014 floods in Bosnia and Herzegovina, many public buildings were destroyed or damaged. The State, NGOs and other entities joined in the renovation efforts. In July 2014, top priority was given to the renovation of schools so that instruction could start normally in November 2014. Major health centres were also high on the list of priorities. Some other public buildings in smaller villages were not included on this list, and due to insufficient funds many buildings have not yet been renovated. Consequently, work in these institutions is obstructed and residents are deprived of the services provided. The project was designed on the basis of identified local needs regarding public buildings in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The project foresees the renovation of the health centre and fire station in Vidovice damaged during the floods (both buildings were flooded for almost three weeks); the village of Vidovice is located in the Municipality of Ora�je on the Sava River. Project goals: improve the conditions for providing basic health care to Vidovice residents and improve the conditions for ensuring fire protection and safety in the case of natural disasters in the area.

STREAMLINING THE RESPONSE TO HIV/AIDS  EPIDEMIC IN AZERBAIJAN BY STRENGTHENING NATIONAL CAPACITIES AND SCALING UP PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. Azerbaijan is a lower-middle income country with a concentrated HIV epidemic. HIV prevalence in adults is estimated at 0.2 percent (UNAIDS, 2008 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic). Although the national burden of HIV appears comparatively low, it is probably underestimated - due, in particular, to difficulties in accessing most-at-risk population groups. The predominant HIV transmission mode is sharing of injecting equipment among people who inject drugs. The government of Azerbaijan is committed to fighting the HIV epidemic and allocates increasing amounts of financial, human and infrastructural resources for this purpose, particularly to cover the substantial costs of staff, medical interventions and facility expenses. However, substantial financial and programmatic gaps exist, especially with regards to the complex and costly interventions in HIV prevention and treatment activities among most-at-risk population groups. The program supported by this grant aims to ensure the continuation and scaling-up of the activities initiated under the Round 4-supported program, which ended in June 2010. This program will initiate new activities, such as expansion of voluntary counseling and testing, ensuring universal access to prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV and establishing community-based care and support.',\n",

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP) is one of the largest public-private partnerships (PPP) in the delivery of primary health care (PHC) in South Asia. The Government of Bangladesh with the assistance of ADB implemented the First Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-I) from March 1998 to June 2005.  The Second Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-II), supported by ADB and the Governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden, commenced in July 2005 and was completed in December 2012.  A provision of $50 million has been made for the Bangladesh Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project (UPHCSDP) in ADB's lending pipeline for 2012 in addition to $400,000 grant support for Supporting the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project in 2012. The UPHCSDP and the grant continue the provision of urban PHC, among others, through successful PPPs pioneered by UPHCP-I and II.   With a density of 2,756 people per square kilometer (km2) in urban areas and 843 people per km2 overall, Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world (excluding a few city-states).  Bangladesh is urbanizing at a rapid pace and the country's urban population is expected to reach 89.5 million (from 39.5 million in 2005) by 2030.  According to one estimate, by 2020 the urban poor figure could be as high as 40%-60% of the urban population.  Notwithstanding higher economic growth in urban areas, the absolute number of poor households is increasing in urban Bangladesh due to migration of rural poor into urban areas. Studies have shown that the health indicators of the urban poor are as worse as those of the rural poor because of poorer living conditions, and limited urban PHC. Failure to provide urban PHC can have serious negative externalities - spread of communicable diseases, debilitating epidemics, reduction in economic productivity, among others.\",\n",

The prevalence among men having sex with other men (MSM) appears to differ between locations, with 5.6 percent in the capital, Vientiane.  In 2008, responses to potentially growing threat of HIV resulted to drafting of an HIV law, funding approval of two Global Fund grants focusing on treatment and care efforts, continuing inclusion of HIV in national priorities, expansion of people living with HIV (PLHIV) networks and involving in their policy and program making, and development of a multi-sectorial monitoring and evaluating five-year strategic plan.  The current grant is a Single Stream Funding (SSF) consolidated Round 4, 6 and 8 HIV programs.  It is expanding the interventions to cover identified gaps in coverage, addressing weaknesses in implementation capacity, and strengthening civil society organizations.

As one of the first schemes of its kind at this scale, Aarogyasri has generated national and international interest. A detailed evaluation is critical not only to keep improving the scheme, but also to ensure that the lessons learned from it benefit other states and countries. The Aarogyasri Trust Board has therefore asked a consortium of institutions to evaluate the scheme and consider its potential role in prevention and primary healthcare.

Participants were followed-up for primary outcomes (maternal haemoglobin, birth weight, and infant survival) and for a series of secondary outcomes based on the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease hypothesis. So far we have demonstrated a remarkable effect of E-MMS on infant and under-five survival, and effects of the interventions on childhood stunting and metabolic markers at 4.5 years. We aim at studying whether the effects of the prenatal interventions on growth and metabolic markers up to 4.5 years are sustained at 10 years, to evaluate if these interventions reduce health disparities, and whether social conditions and maternal stressors modify the effect on children of the interventions, and to analyse the public health impact and the cost-utility of the interventions in order to inform policy and possibilities for scaling-up.',\n",

The project will also increase awareness and understanding of sexual, reproductive, maternal and child health with special focus on men's participation in reproductive, maternal and newborn health and decision making.Project activities include: (1) training health workers from four health centres and 24 dispensaries on: essential maternal and newborn health skills, such as Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC); Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEmONC), family planning; nutrition counselling; and newborn resuscitation; (2) refurbishing four health centres and 24 dispensaries to provide CEmONC, BEmONC, water, sanitation and hygiene and family planning services, including a satellite safe blood center at the regional hospital; (3) equipping targeted health facilities with the necessary stocks of equipment and commodities to provide BEmONC, CEmONC, family planning and safe blood services; (4) establishing a referral system for maternal and newborn health care and family planning services across all tiers of the health system; (5) training and supporting Ministry of Health and facility-based managers, and health workers to improve community to facility linkages (enhanced data collection, consolidation, analysis and reporting); and (6) training and equipping community health workers, traditional birth attendants, traditional healers, and local leaders to provide community-level health promotion services (including maternal and newborn health, water, sanitation and hygiene, family planning, nutrition, gender issues and use of mobile health technology to mobilize communities).The project is implemented in collaboration with Amref Health Africa in Tanzania, Marie Stopes Tanzania and Deloitte./ Le projet vise a rTduire la mortalitT et la morbiditT des mFres et des nouveau-nTs dans les cinq districts de la rTgion de Simiyu, en Tanzanie.

The project is expected to reduce Palestinian Ministry of Health (MoH) burden of referring patients externally to Jordan or Israel and increasing local capacity to provide specialized health services.Nongovernmental organization (NGO) hospitals like AVH are an integral part of the Palestinian health care system. The Palestinian Authority's MoH relies heavily on NGO hospitals in the West Bank to provide essential secondary and tertiary care to Palestinians that the MoH is unable to provide.AVH, through its provision of specialty health care services, is committed to introducing services that are most commonly sought abroad, reduce overall health care costs, and increase the capacity of Palestinian providers to perform modern and innovative procedures. AVH currently has an on-going contract with the MoH to provide care and treatment for cancer patients. With prior year funding, the hospital is procuring the equipment needed to establish a bone marrow transplantation unit at AVH.Bone marrow transplantation services are not available within the Palestinian health system partially due to a lack of health professionals, especially nurses and allied health staff. With this funding hospital staff will be trained to perform their duties properly and in accordance with accreditation requirements and international standards.\",\n",

One of the fund's projects is campaigning to end fistula. Fistula is an injury that happens at child birth due to prolonged obstructed labour when a passage opens between urethra and the vagina or between the vagina and the rectum. Because of the smell of leaking urine or faeces is hard to eliminate and difficult to ignore and because of this the girls face exclusion from the society they belong to and suffer mentally as well as physically. Those mainly affected are young girls between 12 and 15 that live in densely populated and poorer areas. The condition nearly always leads to death of a child at birth. UNFPA has prioritized this campaign but it has been only 20 years since the problem was dealt with. The fund considers this to be one of it's most important projects since around 93% of the cases can be mended by surgery. Fistula is an extensive problem in Africa, Asia and the Middle-East.\",\n",

Third phase  is especially  targeting PVDs  as they are one of the most HIV vulnerable groups. Through PVD strategy the aim is to include PVDs to existing structure of activities. The strategy is based on Information Education and Communication with a focus on behavioral change communication and to work with individuals and communities through sharing and providing supportive and enabling environments. The implementation is based on a two tier strategy: (i) advocacy sensitization and mobilization of community&religious leaders; and (ii) conduct training of trainers to reach local communities.

MIGRATION, REMITTANCES, AND FOREST DEPENDENCE IN ETHIOPIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR FOOD SECURITY, GENDER, AND FOREST CONSERVATION. This project will provide evidence that offers important insight into the connection between migration, gender, and forest dependence in rural Ethiopia. Need for labour migration, forest resources While most rural households rely on agriculture for their livelihood, many poor households in developing countries use labour migration and forest resources to improve their welfare. Existing research offers simplistic assumptions that migration invariably leads to deforestation in the tropics, and that forest recovery is always a consequence of people leaving rural areas. These assumptions are being questioned, particularly as researchers analyze and document the complex factors that influence migration outcomes. As a result, it is not clear whether labour migration complements, or serves as a substitute, for forest product extraction by migrant-sending households. Furthermore, whether and how labour migration influences intra-household gender relations, food security, and forest dependence at the places of origin is unclear. Insights into the effects on households The Ethiopian Economic Association/Ethiopian Economic Policy Research Institute (EEA-EEPRI) will collaborate with the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) on this project. They will explore the effects of migration and remittances on household forest dependence, food security, and intra-household gender division of work. Researchers will investigate the degree to which those effects vary across different migration types (for example, domestic versus international migration, and rural versus urban) and across socio-economic groups and locations. A better understanding of these issues is of crucial importance in Ethiopia for a number of reasons. The government has formulated and implemented specific policies on gender, forestry, and food security. However, the ways in which rural out-migration is influencing the achievement of gender equity, forest conservation, and rural food security goals are not well understood. This research will aim to propose options for policymakers and development partners. Project leadership This project is made possible through the Think Tank Initiative (TTI).

Objective: I) to conceptualize abortion stigma among health care providers in youth friendly centres, teachers and students in secondary school (14-18 y) in a sub-urban area with high MM, and II) to determine if a school based abortion- and contraceptive-stigma reduction intervention will decrease stigma, and increase contraceptive use among students. Design, Setting, Participants: I) focus group discussions with providers, teachers and students, and II) a quantitative quasi-experimental intervention study involving 800 students from schools in western Kenya that will be cluster-randomised into intervention and control units. Main Outcome: abortion-stigma. Secondary outcome: contraceptive use. Outcome measured by using the validated SABA-scale before and after intervention and comparing intervention and control schools. Analyses: Qualitative content analysis and repeated measures ANOVA (PASW).',\n",

This project seeks to improving the health of women, adolescent girls, mothers, newborns and children in under-served areas taking a community-based approach and working with local health authorities.All project countries have established meaningful health legislation, governance bodies, and in some instances, the necessary infrastructure. Due to weak quality, inclusiveness (e.g. youth-friendliness), and gender-responsiveness of health services delivery and health care management, service delivery, operationalization and increased access and utilization of maternal newborn child health/sexual and reproductive health services (MNCH/SRH) require support. Specific challenges include: 1) weak health seeking behaviour by disadvantaged, vulnerable and marginalised women of child bearing age (WCBA) and their families; Particularly high MNCH/SRH risks exist for adolescent mothers and high rates of child, early, and forced marriage (CEFM); 3) WCBA's lack of decision-making capacity and low access to and control over social and economic assets due, to pervasive gender inequality; 4) inaccessible, fragmented and client-unfriendly health systems; 5) low numbers and inadequate skills of Community Health Workers and frontline workers to provide quality, gender responsive, adolescent friendly health care; and 6) irregular tracking and use of data by Ministry of Health, and poor accountability of health services to local communities.Project activities include: (1) raising awareness of local leaders, role models and various community groups on ongoing MNCH services, positive healthcare practices, including health care seeking behaviours; (2) training health care providers at both community and health facility levels on key MNCH interventions; (3) providing essential medicines and other medical supplies; (4) training health administrators and local health committees on planning, supervision and oversight of health resources and facilities; (5) training for health workers and drivers in referring patients requiring more advanced care at specialized facilities, including providing health facilities with mobile technology and vehicles to facilitate emergency transportation; (6) training and mentoring health care staff on improved data collection and reporting to inform local government resource planning; and, (7) implementing digital and media campaigns to raise awareness of Canadian public on global MNCH issues. This initiative is expected to contribute directly to the improved health of approximately 1 million women, more than 900,000 children under five years of age, and over 200,000 adolescent girls, as well as over 1.1 million men with improved MNCH services.

Ghana has a generalized HIV epidemic with pockets of high prevalence among most-at-risk populations (MARPs), namely men having sex with men (MSM) and their female partners, female sex workers (FSWs), prison inmates, most-at-risk youth (15-24), workers (miners, uniformed services, transport workers), and vulnerable groups such as young boys and girls and female porters, as well as population in some geographic areas which are disproportionally affected by the epidemic. The prevalence rate has remained stable and below 5% over the past 16 years. The current national prevalence is 1.9% and prevalence among pregnant women is 2.6% (2007 sentinel surveillance report: National AIDS Control Program/Ghana Health Services).This Program addresses gaps in the national response such as 1) superficial understanding of HIV in many segments of the population including youth, and an inability to move people from general knowledge and awareness of risk to actually adopting safer behaviors; 2) insufficient targeting of MARPs and vulnerable groups; 3) slow integration of HIV/AIDS and Sexual Reproductive Health (SRH); 4) shortfalls in institutional and community capacities to rapidly scale-up comprehensive HIV services.Recognizing that clients of MARPs serve as a bridge between MARPs and general population in HIV transmission, this Program targets MARPs, vulnerable groups and general population. As part of health system strengthening measures directly related to HIV services, this Program targets blood safety, prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), early infant diagnosis, and integration of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) services.As a part of the strengthening national health system in its response to HIV epidemic and emphasizing the need of stronger partnerships between the public health sector, civil society and the private sector, this Program will be implemented by multiple Principal Recipients, as of the effective date of this Agreement, the Ministry of Health/Ghana Health Services, Ghana AIDS Commission (the Principal Recipient), Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana, Adventist Development and Relief Agency of Ghana. 2.Goal:  To reduce new HIV infections in the general population.Target Group/Beneficiaries:�People living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV);�MARPs: MSM and their female partners, FSWs, Prison inmates, most-at-risk youth (15-24), Workers (miners, uniformed services, transport workers);�Vulnerable groups: young people (aged 15-24), female porters;�Pregnant women;�Infants born to HIV-positive pregnant women; and�General population4.Strategies:�To promote the adoption of safer sexual practices in the general population;�To promote healthy behaviors and the adoption of safer sexual practices among PLHIV, MARPs and vulnerable groups; �To promote the integration of SRH and HIV/AIDS services with emphasis on PMTCT and safe blood transfusions; and�To strengthen the institutional capacity and community systems for scaling-up HIV/AIDS, STI a',\n",

Background and Summary:  The primary goal of this Program is to reinforce the Government of Tanzania's response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by expanding service delivery to the lower tiers of the health system. Attaining this goal requires financing recurring costs, such as Health Products and consumables, as well as supporting activities that maintain and strengthen the system in place, such as refresher training for community health workers, supervision and mentoring. Experience with previous Global Fund grants has highlighted the need for greater coordination among relevant stakeholders. Accordingly, this grant will support the scale up of HIV/AIDS services by strengthening capacity and coordination among key stakeholders in the public and private sectors, including: Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), Faith-based Organizations (FBOs), People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) groups, as well as the Tanzania Commission for AIDS (TACAIDS), the national coordination body for Tanzania's multi-sectoral HIV/AIDS programming.  Tanzania faces an urgent need for drugs and commodities for the delivery of HIV/AIDS services. The scale-up of the national anti-retroviral therapy (ART) program has resulted in a seven-fold increase in the number of patients enrolled in treatment, from 23,951 in 2005 to 189,494 in October 2008. Funding for commodities that are key to the delivery of key services such as HIV testing, Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) management, Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT), ART, Opportunistic Infection (OI) treatment and prophylaxis, and early infant diagnosis will therefore form an integral part of the Program. The Program will additionally measure the outputs, outcomes and impact of HIV/AIDS interventions addressed by the Program. Specifically, this program's main objectives are to scale up through expansion of care and treatment services to primary health care facilities, increase coverage of key prevention services all over the country, ensure continuous quality service delivery and strengthen the national-level stakeholders and coordination mechanisms.  Two Principal Recipients will work on attaining the goals of the program, namely the Ministry of Finance and African Medical Research Foundation (AMREF). 2.

Despite all the efforts that have been made in the field of tuberculosis control in Mozambique, one of the biggest challenges in combating this rapidly spreading disease is to increase the TB detection rate. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of a simple, fast and accurate diagnostic method. Due to this alarming situation, the Mozambican government has declared this epidemic to be a national emergency and for this reason drafted a National Strategic Plan 2008-2012. In 2011, the Mozambican government wants to raise the detection rate from 53% to 58% and substantially increase the recovery rate and the number of TB patients that is tested for HIV/AIDS.  With an eye to finding a solution to this pressing problem of TB diagnosis in countries with limited resources and infrastructure, Apopo has started exploring the possibility of using African HeroRATs to detect tuberculosis.

SCALE UP OF HOMESTEAD FOOD PRODUCTION FOR IMPROVED NUTRITION IN CAMBODIA (CIFSRF PHASE 2). Household food insecurity, seasonal food shortages, and nutritional deficiencies among women and children are prevalent in Cambodia. This project will refine proven innovations in homestead food production and will test cost-sharing, financial, and social impact models at scale to improve nutrition, income, and gender equity. Testing homestead food production approaches Homestead food production empowers the poor with the education and resources they need to raise their own nutritious foods. The project team will ask men and women smallholders living in Cambodia's upland, lowland, and forested regions to self-select from four food production options: -backyard gardens alone -gardens plus fish -gardens plus poultry -gardens plus poultry and fish Researchers from the University of British Columbia and Helen Keller International will identify barriers to participation and factors that motivate farmers to adopt and invest in the intervention. They will integrate underlying factors that influence nutritional outcomes including water, sanitation, and hygiene practices. The project builds on previous research testing homestead food production with vegetable gardens in combination with fish ponds to grow nutrient-dense small fish for household consumption and large fish for sale. The earlier research found that nutritional quality was enhanced, incomes improved, and women had a greater role in household decision-making. Better nutrition, improved food security At the end of three years, 22,500 households and 135,000 individuals are expected to benefit directly and indirectly. The project will provide a package of homestead food production options that can be quickly implemented by government, the public, and the private sector across a Asia and in Africa. The project's focus on scalable innovations that improve the quality of diets (using strategies for vegetable production integrated with aquaculture and poultry) aligns well with Cambodia's new National Strategy for Food Security and Nutrition.\",\n",

BRIDGE II is a USAID-funded five-year strategic, evidence-based communication program that encourages Malawians in 11 districts in the southern region of Malawi to adopt behaviors that prevent HIV transmission. BRIDGE II aims to reduce new HIV infections through eliminating barriers to individual action and shifting social norms. It addresses key risk factors for HIV in Malawi such as having more than one sexual partner at a time, lack of condom use, and alcohol abuse. Gender norms and inequities often lie beneath these risky behaviors, and BRIDGE II openly addresses these issues. A multi-sectoral project with a strong community focus, BRIDGE works directly through creative multi-media campaigns, transformative and participatory toolkits (like the Hope Kit, PDF), interactive radio programs, service referral and linkages, and community theater. BRIDGE also builds local capacity by providing support to community and faith-based networks to strengthen their HIV prevention programs. The goal is lasting, positive change that not only prevents new HIV infections, but also strengthens the ability of Malawis communities to care for and protect themselves.',\n",

ESTABLISHING A HARMONIZED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH REGISTRY IN JORDAN TO IMPROVE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH. This project seeks to improve the quality and timely collection and use of reproductive health data in the Mafraq governorate of Jordan by establishing a harmonized Reproductive Health Registry (hRHR). The dearth and lack of reliable data limits the ability to make informed decisions by health providers, planners and community members, which can influence the well-being of women and children. The proposed implementation research project involving the participatory development of an electronic harmonized reproductive health registry is expected to link timely and accurate health data from local primary care health centres to hospital settings and governorate-level planning bodies, and back to communities. Issues of expanding services to cover vulnerable and undercounted populations are central to the proposed implementation and related research activities. Given the high numbers of Syrian refugees in the Mafraq governorate, the registry will be designed to serve both refugee and non-refugee populations to address different health needs and social contexts of the various groups. The project will also focus on strengthening the capacities of decision-makers at different levels of the health system and other sectors to use the data collected and analyzed through the registry. The project will apply mixed methods to conduct a situational analysis of existing systems and tools of sexual and reproductive health data collection and use; develop a harmonized electronic registry system using participatory approaches and established guidelines from the World Health Organization; strengthen representation of underserved groups of women, men and youth in stakeholder meetings and governance processes; develop a dashboard of data and related analysis; assess the quality, timeliness and reliability of data; and build capacities of researchers and decision-makers. The main outcomes include improved quality and timeliness of reproductive health data, better integration and interoperability among different health facilities, a strengthened referral system, increased capacities by decision-makers and providers to use health data, and costed plans to scale up the hRHR effort to other parts of the country.  This proposal represents one of nine selected as a cohort of implementation research projects spanning two regions (West Africa and the Middle East) and two thematic topics (adolescent sexual and reproductive health and health information systems).  The project is closely aligned with the Government of Canada's new feminist international assistance policy, the strategic priorities detailed in the 2016-2030 WHO led Global Strategy for Women, Children and Adolescents, and the overarching 2030 global agenda for sustainable development.\",\n",

ADDRESSING THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF LEISHMANIASIS IN THE BORDERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, AND PARAGUAY. Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector - borne diseases worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe visceral form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans. This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease ' s emergence and spread in the bordering area through multi - country collaboration. The project squad will develop evidence - based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio - cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will: - analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re - emergence of leishmaniasis; - assess how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries; - identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth - based prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision - makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and, - improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three countries by strengthening cross - country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange. In the area under study, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements ), and tourists. Researchers will study biological, environmental, and societal variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease ' s emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision - makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities ' explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Participants will include decision - makers from the local, subnational, and national levels of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan - American Health Organization. This will enhance uptake of results and implementation of multi - sector prevention and control strategies. It will also help ensure that results are replicated and scaled up in other high - risk areas of the sub - region. The work is expected to set the foundation for novel control strategies and programs in the three countries and inform possible regional responses.\",\n",

FUNCTION OF IMMUNE cellular phone POPULATIONS IN HYPOPIGMENTATION DISORDERS OF AUTOIMMUNE AND INFECTIOUS ORIGIN. Why do citizens pay taxes? This question is surprisingly underexplored. Understanding when citizens pay taxes and wherefore they find it relevant and purposeful is central for answer this question. Tax compliance is a major concern in developing countries and particularly in Sub - Saharan Africa, in order to reduce dependency of foreign aid and increase state revenues for providing adequate health, educational and infrastructural services for their populations. In a nutshell, taxes are needed to build capable states that can provide for their citizens. Remarkably, taxation has not figured centrally on the agenda among scholars working on statebuilding in Africa or the African voter. Determinants of willingness to pay taxes in developing countries need to be scrutinized using an insiders ' perspective of what it means to be a tax payer on an everyday basis across different socioeconomic groups. This project expands on current explanations through focusing on the social practice of taxes; when, how and where taxation occurs and how this practice forms part of the everyday for ordinary citizens. This is studied through an ethnographic study of the practices surrounding tax payment in three cases in Sub - Saharan Africa (Lesotho, Tanzania and Zambia ), where the willingness to pay taxes and the relative tax burden vary. A comparative micro - study of citizens ' experience with taxes, using interviews and observations, will reveal the room for building a tax paying culture.\",\n",

This include studies to elucidate immune mechanisms and antigens of importance for protection against diseases caused by these bacteria and to construct and evaluate promising candidate vaccines for safety and immunogenicity, initially in animals and subsequently in humans. It also includes a search for new ETEC colonization factors and analyses of emerging ETEC clones by means of whole genome sequencing. A new oral ETEC candidate vaccine developed by us, consisting of recombinant E. coli bacteria over - expressing the most important ETEC colonization factors and a anatoxin will be evaluated alone and together with a promising mucosal adjuvant for safety and immunogenicity in Phase I / II studies, initially in Sweden and subsequently in descending age groups in Bangladesh. The aim is also to identify simple interventions such as calorie and micronutrient supplementation, changed breast feeding patterns, anti - parasite treatment that may improve immune responses against enteric vaccines in children in developing countries.

This project, managed by the American University of Beirut, will survey public health academics and practitioners around the world about their attitudes and practices around funding from for - profit corporations, particularly those whose products are associated with non - communicable diseases. The project will also review existing policies that govern schools of public health around the globe with respect to taking funds from for - profit corporations. The project will focus on schools and programs of public health in the Eastern Mediterranean region, North America, Africa, and Southeast Asia.',\n",

These statistics provide policymakers and practitioners with the necessary evidence to design interventions and enact appropriate policies on maternal and child health. Many low - and center - income countries, however, do not systematically collect such crucial information. It is estimated that one - third of the world ' s births and two - thirds of the world ' s deaths are not registered or are incorrectly certified. In many cases, global norms, standards, tools, and good practices are not readily accessible and useable to those who need them most. The project will establish the Centre of Excellence for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Systems to provide information, tools, and expertise to facilitate the development and implementation of integrated CRVS systems.

The aim of this collaborative research project is to examine the role of antigen diversity on the antibody response and acquired immunity against clinical episodes of malaria; with the overall purpose of identifying candidate antigens to be included in a multi - component malaria vaccine. The project will describe parasite diversity in relation to antibody responses and protective immunity in individuals with different degree of exposure within defined geographical regions in Ghana and Kenya, as well as in travellers experiencing first time infections. We will focus on a subset of antigens (n = 10) that have been shown to be potential targets of protective immunity and include both conserved and polymorphic proteins. We will sequence the sponger collected from the community to define precisely the diversity at the selected loci, express these antigens and then analyse the antibody responses to conserve and diverse antigens. We will specifically investigate compounding of antigens and variants of antigens to which antibodies confer protection. The project will use samples that are and have been collected within longitudinal well - established cohorts in Ghana and Kenya, as well as Swedish travelers.

Health is suit a core feature of global negotiations, whether they relate to trade, economic growth, or social development. New research will help boost Africa ' s bargaining power in global health diplomacy, The term global health diplomacy has been coined to describe the multidisciplinary work related to diplomacy, public policy, and global health. But an underlying North - South divide exists in this area, leaving Africa - and sub - Saharan Africa in particular - at a disadvantage. Although the region is highly integrated in the global economy, it has little bargaining power in such high - level negotiations. In health, for example, this has consequences when global level agreements and negotiations limit the space for national policy decisions on the development and strengthening of equitable health systems. This research aims to examine and communicate the most important elements countries need to assert their public health interests in global wellness diplomacy from an African perspective. The research will look at three examples of global health diplomacy important to sub - Saharan Africa: 1) the implementation of the World Health Organization ' s Code on International Recruitment of Health Personnel; 2) new collaboration on access to essential drugs through South - South relationships involving Africa, China, Brazil, and India; and 3) the involvement of African actors in getting universal access to prevention, treatment, and care for HIV and AIDS.

ADDRESSING THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF LEISHMANIASIS IN THE BORDERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, AND PARAGUAY. Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector - borne diseases worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe visceral form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans. This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease ' s emergence and spread in the bordering regions through multi - country collaboration. The project team will develop evidence - based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio - cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will: - analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re - emergence of leishmaniasis; - assess how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries; - identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth - based prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision - makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and, - improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three country by strengthening cross - country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange. In the area under study, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements ), and tourists. Researchers will study biological, environmental, and social variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease ' s emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision - makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities ' explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Player will include decision - makers from the local, subnational, and national levels of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan - American Health Organization.

These statistics provide policymakers and practitioners with the necessary evidence to design interventions and enact appropriate policies on maternal and child health. Many low - and middle - income countries, however, do not systematically collect such crucial information. It is estimated that one - third of the world ' s births and two - thirds of the world ' s deaths are not registered or are incorrectly certified. In many cases, global norms, standards, tools, and good practices are not readily accessible and useable to those who need them most. The project will establish the Centre of Excellence for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Systems to provide information, tools, and expertise to facilitate the development and implementation of integrated CRVS systems. Funded by Global Affairs Canada and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC ), and based at IDRC, the Centre of Excellence will coordinate with existing expert groups to generate, consolidate, and share information and resources in an open and collaborative electronic platform.

We have previously been deeply involved in the development of the internationally available, closely related oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) Dukoral � and Shanchol �. These vaccines are effective, but the use of several strains and two inactivation methods makes their manufacture complex and relatively expensive, and OCVs are therefore still severely underused globally. In developing a new generation of OCVs, a central aim is to make it affordable for the populations in greatest need. This can be achieved by simplifying manufacture whilst maintaining the levels of protection afforded by currently available OCVs. Using a single vaccine strain and one inactivation method would considerably simplify and reduce the cost of manufacture. We have recently developed a novel concept and also engineered a new type of vaccine strains for such a new generation of OCVs, whereby the several V. cholerae O1 components in Dukoral and Shanchol can be replaced by a single - mental strain / single - formulation component with full retention of protective immunogenicity. We now propose, in collaboration with partners in India and Bangladesh, (1) to develop this novel single - strain OCV prototype combined with recombinantly produced cholera toxin B subunit into a truly low - cost, and also thermo - and pH - stable vaccine formulation for worldwide use including stockpiling purposes. A first - generation of the new OCV is planned to go into clinical testing in Bangladesh in early 2017 with product approval hoped for already in 2018 / 19. In parallel, (2) we will also develop a second - generation OCV formulation, which by including a novel cholera - toxin - derived mucosal adjuvant may provide adequate protection after single - dose administration, a feature which would be especially valuable for use in cholera outbreaks. The projected novel, low - cost, thermo - and pH - stable vaccine can be produced at a fraction of the cost of current vaccines, and should equal attractive for worldwide use including stockpiling purposes.

We will investigate consequences of air pollution in a prospective cohort of women recruited during pregnancy at public health facilities in Ethiopia. Outdoor air pollution will be assessed by high quality modelling which combines measurements with Geographical Information System tools and aerial and topographical imaging. Individual exposure will be linked to the model by residential address. Indoor exposure will be assessed by questionnaires and validated by measurements. Emission factors from different fuels and cooking methods, and particle characteristics will be assessed in our Aerosol Lab in Lund.

West Africa has many of the lowest development indicators in the world - 10 of the 15 member states of the West African Community number among the world ' s 35 low - income countries. The World Health Organization reports that 14 of the member states have a high maternal mortality ratio, defined as 300 or more maternal deaths per 100, 000 live births.

The outcome of an infection is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. How the combined impact of more than one factor influence infection is at large unknown in both humans and experimental models. Intestinal parasitic infections are the rule sort of than the exception in poor rural communities, where clean water, proper housing and sewage systems are not available allowing a continuous transmission of helminths and other water - born infectious organisms. In this project we aim to see how gastro - intestinal parasitic infections influence and are influenced by nutritional status and if the combination of malnutrition and intestinal parasitic infection is a risk factor for development of trypanosomal disease in humans. In animal models we will explore how the combination of gastrointestinal infection and malnourishment influences the outcome of Leishmania and Trypanosoma cruzi infection, two related parasitic infections, which are endemic in Bolivia. The project will be divided into two parts, in Bolivia clinico - epidemiological studies will provide information on nutritional status and how this correlates with polyparasitism and different immune parameters. The other part, which primarily will follow conducted at Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, is an experimental animal set up, where the impact of the most common nutritional deficiencies of poor populations can be tested on trypanosome infections in a mono or polyparasitic context.',\n",

VECTOR CONTROL BY MULTIPLE CLASSES OF SMALL ORGANIC COMPOUNDS TO COMBAT MOSQUITO - BORNE INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND SUPPRESS INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE. Insect vectors transmit numerous viral - and parasite infections between humans or from animals to humans. Worst affected are poor people living in vulnerable communities in tropical and sub - tropical regions. Vector control by insecticides is the dominant way to combat and prevent transmission of mosquito - borne diseases. Due to globalization, environmental changes and increased insecticide resistance, there is an urgent need for new approaches and strategies for efficient vector control. This proposal aims to design, synthesize and develop multiple novel chemical classes of insecticides for control of Aedes aegypti (transmits e. g. dengue and chikungunya) and Anopheles gambiae (transmits malaria ). We will target a form of acetylcholinesterase (AChE1) not present in vertebrates, and identify diverse selective chemical starting points by high throughput screening (HTS ). Evaluation of a performed HTS targeting mosquito AChE1 has shown promising results. We have identified several classes of substances that are selective for the mosquito - form over human AChE. These multiple chemical starting points will be synthetically explored and optimized into insect powder. Early on in the discovery process we will include, in addition to the target - specific endpoints, response estimates that address human safety, environmental fate and effect, resistance sensitivity, and cost of goods. Mosquito testing, including laboratory testing and field studies, will be performed in Kenya.',\n",

ADDRESSING THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF LEISHMANIASIS IN THE BORDERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, AND PARAGUAY. Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector - borne diseases worldwide, with more than deuce million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe visceral form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans. This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease ' s emergence and spread in the bordering regions through multi - country collaboration. The project team will develop evidence - based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio - cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will: - analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re - emergence of leishmaniasis; - assess how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries; - identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth - based prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision - makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and, - improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three countries by strengthening cross - country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange. In the area under study, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements ), and tourists. Researchers will study biological, environmental, and social variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease ' s emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision - makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities ' explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Participants will include decision - makers from the local, subnational, and national levels of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan - American Health Organization. This will enhance uptake of results and implementation of multi - sector prevention and controller strategies. It will also help ensure that results are replicated and scaled up in other high - risk areas of the sub - region. The work is expected to set the foundation for novel control strategies and programs in the three countries and inform possible regional responses.\",\n",

The partnership uses an ecohealth approach to address the complexity of emerging infectious diseases. This project presents a new phase of APEIR research on emerging threats from antimicrobial resistance and wildlife trade. It aims to strengthen the field of ecohealth and enhance emerging infectious disease control in Asia through research, capacity building, social and policy advocacy, and stronger knowledge and response networks. The wide use and abuse of antimicrobials as anti - infective drugs and non - therapeutic treatments are key contributors to persistent infections caused by resistance to antimicrobials. This use and abuse is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. In China and Southeast Asia, the lack of policy or regulation enforcements means that the use of antibiotics is not well - controlled. This research will provide evidence and guidance to make grow country - specific and regional strategies to improve the responsible use of antibiotics and to reduce the emergence of resistant infectious agents in China, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. Southeast Asia ' s thriving wildlife trade supports disease transmission to humans. It also threatens livestock, international trade, rural livelihoods, native wildlife populations, and ecosystem health. Little is known about the zoonotic disease risks involved in transmitting diseases between brute and humans. This study will assess the pathogens that circulate and will explore possible pathways of transmission to humans, specifically in China, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. It will help prevent emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.

ACQUIRED IMMUNITY TO MALARIA: IMPORTANCE OF THE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF PLASMODIUM FALCIPARUM. Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is a potentially fatal infection. Understanding how the extensive genetic polymorphism of the parasite affects the acquisition and maintenance of immunity is a prerequisite for the development of efficacious control tools such as vaccines. In our previous studies, we have shown that persistent asymptomatic multiclonal infections predict a reduced risk of disease in high transmission settings. The aim of this project is to further establish how the hereditary diversity of P. falciparum infection affects protective immunity to malaria. We will investigate polymorphisms in P. falciparum antigen genes, i. e. genes under immune selection, in person with different levels of exposure and immunity both within and between geographical areas, and identify potential? hotspots? of transmission. The genetic diversity of P. falciparum infections will be related to the breadth and magnitude of antibody responses directed to a panel of several P. falciparum antigens. The longevity of immune responses (antimalarial antibody and memory B cell responses) will be studied. The project includes well defined and closely monitored cohorts living in areas of different transmission in Kenya, Tanzania and Mali, as well as Swedish traveller who experience malaria for the first time. The project will contribute to the understanding of the molecular epidemiology of P. falciparum and the acquisition and maintenance of protective immunity against malaria.',\n",

Women are particularly vulnerable to malaria during pregnancy because malaria parasites accumulate in the placenta and the condition is estimated to be responsible for 200 000 infant deaths annually. The disease mechanisms are poorly understood, largely due to the lack of adequate animal models. We propose to use a placental perfusion model to study the interaction between malaria parasites accumulated in the human placenta in relation to the development of preeclampsia with ot without intrauterine growth restriction. The studies will also provide immediate guidance for ongoing efforts to develop a vaccine, protecting women from pregnancy malaria, and basic insight about the disease processes, which can lead to new treatment and prevention strategies for these complicated pregnancies affecting women in the sub - Saharan region. The specific aims of this project are to uncover common disease mechanisms behind PE with or without IUGR and pregnancy - associated malaria (PAM ); to enable predictive diagnosis of high risk of infection cases in the field; to prove feasibility of a cure using A1M in perfusion experiments.

ASSESSING THE ATTITUDES AND PRACTICES OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS REGARDING FUNDING FROM FOR - PROFIT CORPORATIONS. Over the retiring two decades many corporations have begun philanthropic contributions to communities under the rubric of ' Corporate Social Responsibility '. Corporations have sought to engage with universities to support and augment their research and training activities. In an era of dwindling support for research and practice from governments and foundation, many universities have in turn begun to solicit funds from businesses. However, in the case of schools of public health, a number of corporations sought as potential funders make products that may be considered harmful to health operating theatre a threat to the environment - creating a potential conflict of interest. Among public health institutions there are no generalized guidelines to govern the receipt of research and sponsorship funds from for - profit corporations. Practices differ by schools and programs of public health. Though some guidelines have been developed to monitor such potential conflicts of interest, no systematic research has yet explored the attitudes and behaviors of public health researchers and academicians with respect to corporate funding. The research objectives of this project managed by the American University of Beirut are to assess: 1) the attitudes and practices of public health academics globally with respect to taking funds from for - profit corporations - particularly those whose products are associated with non - communicable diseases; and, 2) the policies that govern schools of public health around the globe with respect to taking funds from for - profit corporations. Schools and programs of public health in the Eastern Mediterranean region, North America, Africa and Southeast Asia will be included in this research.

ADDRESSING THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF LEISHMANIASIS IN THE BORDERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, AND PARAGUAY. Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector - borne diseases worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe visceral form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay take the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans. This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease ' s emergence and spread in the bordering regions through multi - country collaboration. The project team will develop evidence - based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio - cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will: - analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re - emergence of leishmaniasis; - tax how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries; - identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth - based prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision - makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and, - improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three countries by strengthening cross - country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange. In the area under study, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements ), and tourists. Researchers will study biological, environmental, and social variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease ' s emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision - makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities ' explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Participants will include decision - makers from the local, subnational, and national levels of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan - American Health Organization. This will enhance uptake of results and implementation of multi - sector prevention and control strategies. It will also help ensure that results are replicated and scaled up in other high - risk areas of the sub - region. The piece of work is expected to set the foundation for novel control strategies and programs in the three countries and inform possible regional responses.\",\n",

USING NEXT GENERATION SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES (NGS) TO FIND Deoxyadenosine monophosphate CURE FOR HUMAN AND CATTLE FILARIASIS. . Lymphatic filariasis is the 2nd most common cause of permanent and long term disability in the world. In Sri Lanka approximately 50% of the population (9. 8 million people) is at risk of contracting bancroftian filariasis. Permanent and long term disability as well as acute attacks of filariasis affects the productivity of persons and causes loss of income. Currently no vaccinum is available for human filarisis. There are only two drugs available for treating human lymphatic filariasis: The worm Wuchereria bancrofti is responsible for approximately 115 million cases and approximately 13 million is caused by Brugia malayi. Although W. bancrofti is the major causative organism, very little is known about the molecular biology, biochemistry and immune mechanisms of this parasite. W. bancrofti cannot be maintained in the laboratory and this is an impediment for testing new treatment forms in laboratory conditions. The project described in this proposal proposes the use of a cattle filarial parasite, Setaria digitata, as the model organism. This project will sequence and annotate the complete genome of Setaria digitata using NGS tecnologies. Work that will allow the identification of genes susceptible to drugs.

Registration of events, such as birth, death, causes of death, marriage, and divorce, is critical for improving maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health. These statistics provide policymakers and practitioners with the necessary evidence to design interventions and enact appropriate policies on maternal and child health. Many low - and middle - income countries, however, do not systematically collect such crucial information. It is estimated that one - third of the world ' s births and two - thirds of the world ' s deaths are not registered or are incorrectly certified. In many cases, global norms, standards, tools, and good practices are not readily accessible and useable to those who need them most. The project will establish the Centre of Excellence for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Systems to provide information, tools, and expertise to facilitate the development and implementation of integrated CRVS systems. Funded by Global Affairs Canada and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC ), and based at IDRC, the Centre of Excellence will coordinate with existing expert groups to generate, consolidate, and plowshare information and resources in an open and collaborative electronic platform. It will also assist countries needing more direct support by facilitating the exchange of good practices and capacity strengthening, and will play an important role brokering technical assistance for countries needing more direct support.

NOVEL PROTEIN MICROARRAY TECHNOLOGIES FOR AFFORDABLE AND RAPID HIGH PERFORMANCE POINT OF CARE DIAGNOSTICS OF SEVERE INFECTIONS IN LOW - INCOME SETTINGS. Infectious diseases is the major grounds of death in low - income countries, especially in Sub - Saharan Africa. Rapid tests for Malaria and HIV have in late years dramatically improved management of patients and are extremely useful where there is no access to laboratories and qualified staff. However, today no rapid tests are available for many of the most serious infectious diseases such as TB and pneumonia, and further the sheer number of rapid tests is becoming untenable financially and practically. We will employ protein microarray technology to allow simultaneous detection of a patient ' s antibody - response to a variety of pathogens, where each pathogen ' s unique antibody signature allows greatly improved specificity. Our group has recently developed novel microarray formats that through use of certain nitrocellulose substrates and novel nanoparticle - based amplification strategies allow retained accuracy as compared with lab - base assays within 10 minutes of analysis at a fraction of the cost. The main focus of the project is to create a rapid test for reliable determination of active / latent TB in pediatric patients and at the same time detect signatures of a number of other relevant viral, bacterial and parasitic infections. The method development will be done at the Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm, whereas the field testing will be done in collaboration with partners at the Mbarara hospital in Uganda and the division of Global Health at the Karolinska Institute.\",\n",

Our central server receives the virtual slides and allows the biological samples to be remotely analyzed by automated computer vision or visually assessed by a human observer. A proof - of - concept study supported by the Swedish Research Council has been conducted in 2014 - 2015 and shown the method to be feasible. We now plan to implement the novel multipurpose diagnostic platform in two settings in United republic of tanzania: 1) As a diagnostic method for detection of malaria in blood samples obtained from patients presenting with fever at the primary health care level and 2) as a diagnostic and monitoring method for detection of soil - transmitted helminthes and schistosomiasis in stool and urine obtained from schoolchildren within a transmission surveillance sight. Captured digital images of the specimens are transferred to the central server to detect malaria parasites in blood smears, and helminth eggs in stool and urine, and to return the results to the technician in the field. The point - of - care study will be carried out in the Bagamoyo District and the transmission surveillance study in the Masasi / Muheza District in Tanzania in collaboration with Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS ). The study will include a comparison with conventional microscopy with regard to diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value ), an evaluation of usability, interpretability and assessment of time to achieve diagnosis. The project advances the field by bringing a powerful, multiplexed diagnostic tool from the laboratory to the point - of - care. The instruments are constructed out of components of mobile phones, make use of the expanding mobile networks and allow remote image processing in a highly scalable cloud computing environment. Previous mobile microscopy projects have been limited with regard to the sample area that can be captured, whereas the technology to be tested in the current project can digitally scan an entire microscopy slide. The method will aid in the combat of infectious diseases at the point - of - care level of health care and has the potential to improve access to diagnostics, enable task - shifting and shorten the time to diagnosis.',\n",

ADDRESSING THE EMERGENCE AND SPREAD OF LEISHMANIASIS IN THE BORDERS OF ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, AND PARAGUAY. Leishmaniasis is one of the most significant vector - borne diseases worldwide, with more than 2 million new cases recorded every year. In South America, both cutaneous leishmaniasis (skin infections) and the more severe splanchnic form of the disease (affecting vital organs) are emerging in many countries and expanding northward and southward. The border areas of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay have the highest burden of the disease in the region. Its emergence is strongly associated with environmental and anthropogenic changes, or pollution caused by humans. This research project aims to enhance prevention and control responses to the disease ' s emergence and spread in the bordering regions through multi - country collaboration. The project team will develop evidence - based interventions which can be adapted to diverse socio - cultural and ecological settings. More specifically, researchers will: - analyze social, environmental, and biological drivers causing the emergence or re - emergence of leishmaniasis; - assess how the disease is distributed and spread in time and space in the common borders between the three countries; - identify and develop innovative and effective ecohealth - establish prevention strategies involving communities, researchers, and decision - makers from different jurisdictional levels and sectors; and, - improve vector and leishmaniasis control strategies in the three countries by strengthening cross - country collaboration, skills building, and knowledge exchange. In the area under discipline, different forms of transmission occur in a diversity of settings, ranging from forest to urban ecosystems, and from work to domestic environments. The region also has a diverse population, including the Guarani people, migrants (transient and permanent settlements ), and tourists. Researchers will study biological, environmental, and social variables associated with disease transmission risks in different types of landscapes. In each country, a specific set of interventions will be developed to address the disease ' s emergence and spread. The project will engage researchers and decision - makers from the three countries to respond to public health authorities ' explicit demands to improve the effectiveness of control programs. Participants will include decision - makers from the local, subnational, and national level of the three countries, and technical experts from the Pan - American Health Organization. This will enhance uptake of results and implementation of multi - sector prevention and control strategies. It will also help ensure that results are replicated and scale up in other high - risk areas of the sub - region. The work is expected to set the foundation for novel control strategies and programs in the three countries and inform possible regional responses.\",\n",
