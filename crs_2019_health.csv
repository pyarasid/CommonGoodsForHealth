Swedish Mission Council Humanitarian frame 2017-2019 - Swedish Mission Council. SWEDISH MISSION COUNCIL HUMANITARIAN FRAME 2017-2019 - SWEDISH MISSION COUNCIL. The proposed programme by the Swedish Mission Council (SMC) is humanitarian and aims at meeting the humanitarian needs of affected populations in the short- and medium-term by providing emergency humanitarian support such as clean water and sanitation. In this appraisal, Sida makes the assessment that the proposed programme is relevant in relation to the Strategy for Sweden's Humanitarian Assistance provided through Sida 2017 - 2020, and that a three-year agreement on strategic partnership should be entered into between Sida and SMC for the period 1 April 2017 - 31 March 2020.In its proposal for 2017, SMC has applied for a total amount of 46,5 million SEK which includes 1) work in six countries (35,5 million SEK); 2) interventions through the Rapid Response Mechanism (10 million SEK); and 3) capacity development support (1 million SEK). During 2017 SMC proposes to work with four member organizations which are ADRA (Adventist Development and Relief Agency), IAS (International Aid Services), CCS (Christian Council of Sweden) and PMU (Pingsmissionens utvecklingssamarbete). SMC, founded in 1912, is an ecumenical membership-based organization with 35 member organizations who are active in 46 countries. The organization is engaged in both development work and humanitarian assistance and became a framework organization for Sida/CIVSAM already in 1980, while the strategic partnership with Sida in terms of humanitarian assistance was initiated as late as 2014. The 35 members are Swedish churches and Christian organizations with long histories of international work - the role of SMC is generally to support, facilitate and coordinate these partner organizations and their local partners' work.",0.546554

The local immune response in the airways and blood of contacts early after TB exposure determines outcome. THE LOCAL IMMUNE RESPONSE IN THE AIRWAYS AND BLOOD OF CONTACTS EARLY AFTER TB EXPOSURE DETERMINES OUTCOME. Programme: Investigator Award in Science. Description: Most individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remain healthy, while a subset only progress to active tuberculosis (TB) disease. Early local immune events following infection in humans, determining the pattern of ensuing host immunity and risk of disease progression, are unknown. We defined a blood transcriptional signature of active TB, absent in the majority of latently exposed asymptomatic individuals and healthy controls, that reflected the extent of radiographic lung disease. I recently demonstrated immunological heterogeneity in the blood transcriptome of a cohort of recent TB contacts. A small proportion expressed a persistent TB signature and subsequently progressed to active TB disease, whereas 50% of contacts who were sensitized to M. tuberculosis infection but did not progress to disease, exhibited a similar, but not identical, transient blood signature, suggesting early local immune responses are critical determinants of outcome from infection. I will now lead a study of TB contacts to detect changes in immune events in the airways early after TB exposure, comparing with TB patients, in a low TB burden setting.The findings I will generate on the local early response to M. tuberculosis infection are critical for developing novel approaches for effective TB control and prevention and the improvement of vaccines.",2.694918

29,2019,Canada,Kenya,How can a gender lens enhance maternal and child health social enterprises in Africa? (IMCHA),12110,HOW CAN A GENDER LENS ENHANCE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH SOCIAL ENTERPRISES IN AFRICA? (IMCHA),"12110. How can a gender lens enhance maternal and child health social enterprises in Africa? (IMCHA). HOW CAN A GENDER LENS ENHANCE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH SOCIAL ENTERPRISES IN AFRICA? (IMCHA). Research shows that high gender inequity translates into poor health for mothers, pregnant women, and children. At the community and individual level, gender inequities and disparities can underlie dimensions of poverty among women. Low socioeconomic status can be associated with high fertility rates, low educational attainment, higher burden of disease, and HIV/AIDS. Gender inequities and disparities also affect access to healthcare services for women and children, particularly in fragile contexts.Social enterprise-based models have great potential to improve maternal and child health (MCH) services and they can also be used to provide an improved source of income for women. A social enterprise is an organization that applies commercial strategies to maximize improvements in human and environmental well-being, such as a cooperative or a community organization. An initial study of social enterprise approaches to MCH care in Africa identified two primary social enterprise models: one based on primary health clinics and one based on mobile community health promoters and sales agents. Gender dynamics played an important role between women and healthcare providers, healthcare providers and social enterprises, and social enterprises and their impact on the individual or community. However, these relationships have not been adequately explored in relation to their impact on maternal and child healthcare services and related outcomes for women and children.The aim of this project, implemented by BRAC Africa, is to improve the understanding of how gender and the social enterprise approach can improve access to maternal and child health services and to outcomes across Africa and globally. The research methodology will include: a systematic literature review and mapping on gender equality, maternal and child health, and social enterprise; a survey to provide basic insight and foundational knowledge into structures and practices; and gender analysis involving both primary and secondary research using key informant interviews and focus group discussions. This will build on an existing IMCHA projects in partnership with BRAC Africa in order to expand the knowledge base about gender equality and social enterprises targeted at improving maternal and child health outcomes as well as identifying practical lessons and promising strategies.This project is funded by the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa program. It is a seven-year $36 million initiative funded by Global Affairs Canada, IDRC, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.",0.03248

Deciphering the blueprint of the healthy and diseased human brain through the generation of patterned cerebral organoids. DECIPHERING THE BLUEPRINT OF THE HEALTHY AND DISEASED HUMAN BRAIN THROUGH THE GENERATION OF PATTERNED CEREBRAL ORGANOIDS. The cerebral cortex is the centre of higher-order cognitive functioning in mammal brains. The cortex has undergone an evolutionary expansion and acquired a more sophisticated organization in humans. While the rodent cortex is small and smooth, human and primate cortices are large and convoluted. Nevertheless, key structural features have remained conserved throughout evolution. For instance, the neocortex is subdivided into four primary areas: visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor. The allocortex is similarly regionalized, and includes the caudomedial hippocampus, which is the seat of learning and memory. How regional patterning occurs during development has been carefully studied in rodent models. Whether similar processes underlie patterning of the human cortex is unknown, but this is an important area of study given the association between neuropsychiatric disorders and altered connectivity between the thalamus and cortex. This project will use human stem cells to generate self-organizing cerebral organoids (a smaller, simpler version of the organ to be studied) and on-chip cerebral organoid systems to model early brain development and to investigate complex neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorder. Additionally, the project will provide a strong research environment, as well as capacity building and exchange opportunities, for graduate students and researchers based in India. The project is led in Canada by the Sunnybrook Research Institute, working in collaboration with the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in India.This project was selected for funding through the fourth research competition of the Joint Canada-Israel Health Research Program. This initiative is a partnership between IDRC, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Israel Science Foundation, and the Azrieli Foundation.",0.126063

Knowledge exchange workshop on food systems research for obesity prevention in Africa. KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE WORKSHOP ON FOOD SYSTEMS RESEARCH FOR OBESITY PREVENTION IN AFRICA. Food systems in many developing countries in Africa are becoming unhealthier. This is largely a result of rapid urbanization and the associated increase in the availability, affordability, and consumption of unhealthy, ultra-processed food. This in turn is spurring the rising prevalence of obese individuals, especially among the urban poor. IDRC's Food, Environment, and Health program intends to develop a significant portfolio of research projects that aim to prevent the rising burden of obesity and other food-related non-communicable diseases in low and middle-income countries through food systems research. Projects across nine African countries are being funded in an effort to deepen and expand this field of work in the region. However, research capacity and collaboration in the field remain low. Therefore, there is a pressing need to enhance capacity and networking among African researchers, practitioners, and young scientists to improve their understanding of and to promote healthy and sustainable food systems. This project will provide funding for a three-day workshop called Partners for a better food system in Africa that brings experienced and new food system researchers together from across Africa to share knowledge and build networks. The workshop will be hosted by Priority Cost Effective Lessons for System Strengthening South Africa (PRICELESS SA).",0.003421

Diagnosing infectious diseases in low-income countries and regions, having under-developed infrastructures in collaboration with the UN organ FAO/IAEA. DIAGNOSING INFECTIOUS DISEASES IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES AND REGIONS, HAVING UNDER-DEVELOPED INFRASTRUCTURES IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UN ORGAN FAO/IAEA. Defined by the WHO, zoonotic diseases are those diseases and infections that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and man with or without an arthropod intermediate. Such diseases represent one of the leading causes of illness and death from infectious disease. In most developing countries, zoonotic diseases are among those diseases that contribute significantly to an already overly burdened public health system. Infectious and parasitic diseases rank second among the  top killers  of the world and in low-income countries, especially in Africa, these diseases are even the dominant causes of death. The countrywide economic loss due to zoonotic disease is immense, cementing poverty and underdevelopment in many regions of the world.The two populations whose biological and social realities put them at greater risk for the negative impacts of zoonotic diseases are women and children.The present project will, in a multidisciplinary collaboration between a PhD student to be employed in the project and senior researchers at Uppsala University, the UN organ FAO/IAEA labs in Africa, Stockholm University, the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, develop a novel, sensitive, low-cost, diagnostics unit, providing an efficient analytical platform for detection of pathogens causing zoonotic infections in under-developed countries. The unit is based on state-of-the-art nano- and biotechnology and combines analysis of changes in rotation dynamics of probe-tagged magnetic nanobeads with a single-molecule detection approach which applies padlock ligation technique and rolling circle amplification (RCA) of the probed pathogen biomolecules (RNA and DNA).  Specifically the project contains a number of well-defined, subtasks including:•Optimization and development of DNA-base detection of organisms having constant target sequence (first 18 months) and RNA-base detection of organisms having variable target sequence (year 1.5-3.5). This work includes extraction and purification of DNA/RNA target from samples received from the above mentioned labs in Africa as well as design of padlock probes and capture probes.•Optimization of the conjugation protocol used for attaching biomolecules on the surface of the magnetic nanobeads (first 24 months).•Measurements of the RCA products formed from the new padlock probes using the bead-based magnetic bioassay in a commercial AC suceptometer (year 2-3.5). This includes: Determining the limit of detection for the different pathogens, detection of antimicrobial resistance and resistant clones (salmonella and campylobacter), detection of a wide range of different strains of E. coli, investigation of mixed viral populations, subpopulations and individual copies of Avian influenza virus, West Nile virus and Rift Valley Fever virus in clinical samples, introducing new variants of the three viruses in the diagnostic assay.•Detection of pathogen targets in a working prototype",0.04061

On January 27, 2017 the Swedish Red Cross (SRC) submitted an application to Sida for the above-mentioned program with an initial budget of 167.5 MSEK for 2017, 16 MSEK for 2018 and 16 MSK for 2019. The overall objective of the program is to strengthen the resilience of people and communities to crises, and their capacity to recover afterwards, and to reduce the risk that people and communities are affected by crises and disasters. A novelty of the new agreement period is that three country-projects (Afghanistan, DR Congo and Myanmar) are offered multiyear financing as they are protracted crises with a need for preidictable finansing to secure necessary resources and ensure predictability and contextspecific impact.Funds allocated for 2017 will be disbursed in two different payments, after signature of the agreement and after 1 September 2017, following approval of implementation of the action plan established by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies regarding internal management and control. Funds allocated for Ukraine and for a scaled up response in South Sudan (from a budget of 4,5 MSEK to13,5 MSEK) will be disbursed after the SRC has provided Sida with, and Sida's approval of, additional applications for these contexts, and after the SRC has demonstrated in written that the corruption case in Ukraine has been investigated and closed and after Sida's approval of the investigation and its recommendations. The SRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement made up of 190 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Federation (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Sida provides support to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement through two channels: the ICRC and the SRC. The SRC channels most of Sida's support to national societies, the IFRC and the ICRC and works in longterm partnership with forteen countries: Cameroon, DR Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DPRK, Myanmar, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine. The SRC's strategic cooperation with partners within the movement - with other National Societies (NS), IFRC and the ICRC – is essential and gives the SRC the possibility to work at both global and local levels. The SRC is in addition considered to have systems, expertise and capacity to strengthen the local capacity of NS to predict and prevent disasters, as well as to contribute to rapid humanitarian assistance in sudden crises. The SRC has faced difficulties in demonstrating the humanitarian relevance of the Sida-funded programs as they are often situated between humanitarian action and long-term development. The SRC's new humanitarian strategy 2016-2019 does, however, put a greater focus on humanitarian operations and this new approach is reflected in the organisation's application 2017-2019.

The main objective of the ERRY II is to improve food and nutrition security, reduce vulnerability and strengthen resilience capacity of crisis-affected communities in Yemen through creation of sustainable livelihood and access to basic services. There are several sub objectives in order to reach this overall goal: i) increase local actors capacity to deliver services to the community, ii) develop livelihood activities in agriculture, cash-for-work, iii) rehabilitate roads and water systems and agricutural land, iv) introduce renewable energy, solar panels for households, water pumps and local manufacturing. These activities will reduce the risks for people to fall back into a humanitarian situation but also to build resources in the community, resouces that have been depleted during many years of conflict and food insecturity. Conflict sensitivity is built into the programme and it also includes a component to promote social cohesion and capacity to peacefully resolve local conflicts. The contribution is a resilience support financed by a humanitarian allocation.

A major objective with this project is to University of Leon, Nicaragua, transfer technology for diagnosis of Zika and Chikungunya viruses, two mosquito-borne viruses that in recent years have spread explosively in Latin America and which WHO classified as a global threat against humanity. Establishment and quality assured diagnostics of for example Zika virus in endemic regions is of particularly high priority, which WHO has pointed out several times.  A second objective is to identify host genetic factors associated with clinical severity to these pathogens. Our hypothesis is that the large clinical variation of symptoms, from asymptomatic to severe illness following Zika and Chikungunya virus infections, partly depends on host genetic factors. In this project we will collect clinical records, serum and saliva samples (n=400) from individuals infected with Zika/Chikungunya viruses with different degrees of illness and at the same time collect samples from individuals who live in the same environment but do not become sick. We intend to study whether mutations in the histo-blood groups antigens, DC-SIGN, TLR3, Fc?II (CD32), Viperin, CCR5 (CCR5?32) and IFNa and IFN ? contributes to morbidity.

Replicating the MamaToto Program in Rural Tanzania (IMCHA). REPLICATING THE MAMATOTO PROGRAM IN RURAL TANZANIA (IMCHA). This project will address high maternal and newborn mortality in Tanzania by adapting and implementing a maternal and newborn health intervention approach that follows the MamaToto process.Health care in rural TanzaniaThe rural regions of Geita and Mwanza have some of the worst maternal and child health indicators in the country. Local health facilities are under-resourced and possess limited management capacity. While the national policy calls for a community health-worker program, the reality is that there are gaps in coordinating and implementing community health services at local levels. Community health-workers have limited training and supervision. The Government of Tanzania's new commitment to improving mothers and children's well-being needs evidence that will support the creation of stronger health systems through community-based interventions. The MamaToto approachThis project draws on the low-cost MamaToto (mother-baby) process implemented in Uganda, where substantial gains in maternal and child health were achieved. These gains took place through an approach that strengthened services at health facilities and within communities. This project will implement and evaluate a modified version of MamaToto in rural Tanzania, aligned with the country's current policy guidance for community health services. The project team will engage district leaders, strengthen facility services, and develop the role of community health workers. They will demonstrate if and how community-based interventions can reduce maternal and child mortality by effectively bringing low-cost program efforts to scale under government leadership.This project aims to scale up national maternal and child health programs that will improve survival rates for mothers and children. Based on these interventions, the project team will develop an implementation package that includes lessons learned, tools, and other materials to allow other jurisdictions to undertake similar initiatives.Project partnersThis project is part of the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa program. The program is a seven-year $36 million initiative funded by Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development Canada (DFATD), Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).",0.02321

The economics of interventions to improve adolescent and reproductive health interventions in selected West African countries. THE ECONOMICS OF INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE ADOLESCENT AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS IN SELECTED WEST AFRICAN COUNTRIES. Decisions made during adolescence have a significant impact on health and overall well-being in later life. Early onset of sexual activity and poor access to information and services have created new vulnerabilities to sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and unplanned pregnancy. Experts argue that a global grand convergence in health in all countries by 2030 (reducing infectious disease, child, and maternal mortality rates to those found in the best-performing middle-income countries) can be achieved by tackling preventable and treatable adolescent health issues. To achieve this global grand convergence, national governments have a critical role to play in supporting multi-level and multi-component intersectoral actions at different levels, from the household to community settings, schools, and health services. Although a few West African countries have made plans to address and improve adolescent sexual and reproductive health outcomes, there is a lack of information about the cost, necessary resources, and requirements for scaling up the planned interventions. Given that government health budgets in Africa remain low, using this information to make the economic case for improving adolescent sexual and reproductive health will be key to mobilizing ongoing domestic resources to sustainably finance interventions and to improve the implementation environment. This project will undertake a detailed situation analysis of national government strategies and policies on adolescent health in selected Francophone and Anglophone countries. Cost estimations, resource needs, and funding gaps will then be undertaken for promising interventions that are identified regionally and nationally. Finally, effective advocacy will be developed along with innovative and sustainable resource mobilization strategies for financing effective adolescent sexual and reproductive health interventions.The project aims to strengthen the generation and application of a quality evidence base about feasible and cost-effective adolescent sexual and reproductive health interventions. It will also contribute to stakeholder processes to influence policy and practice around ensuring availability of required resources. The project will be implemented by the Ghana-based African Health Economics and Policy Association.",0.06202

OUTREACH, COMMUNICATIONS AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION FUND FOR PROMOTING MATERNAL, ADOLESCENT AND CHILD HEALTH RESEARCH. The health of women, children, and adolescents is a key development priority of the Canadian government and part of the global Sustainable Development Goals. In alignment with these global priorities, IDRC's Maternal and Child Health (MCH) program supports a rich portfolio of implementation research projects that work towards improving the quality, accessibility, and accountability of health services in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), with a focus on adolescent sexual and reproductive health and health information systems. MCH's approach has been to support LMIC researchers, policymakers, and implementers to influence national, regional, and global agendas through strategic meetings, dialogues, and by disseminating and using research results. The 2019-2020 financial year holds several crucial engagements where MCH and MCH-supported researchers can and should maximize opportunities to disseminate research findings, share thought leadership perspectives, and support emerging young researchers. This project aims to communicate the strategic priorities and contributions of the MCH program and to disseminate the research results of supported projects to produce greater visibility and reach for impact. A range of outreach opportunities and communication products will be developed through this fund to disseminate research results and to enable the strategic involvement of IDRC grantees in key events and conferences (e.g. Women Deliver) to promote knowledge exchange and to influence policies, practices, agendas, and funding priorities. Funds will also support strategic planning pieces. Collectively, the intent is to leverage appropriate opportunities that enable the mobilization of knowledge into policy processes.",0.010173

ETHIOPIA – NUTRITION SUPPORT FOR SOUTH SUDANESE REFUGEES - CONCERN WORLDWIDE  2018/ÉTHIOPIE – AIDE EN NUTRITION POUR LES RÉFUGIÉS SUD-SOUDANAIS - CONC. March 2018 – Ethiopia hosts the second largest number of refugees in Africa, nearly one million people. Approximatelyy 40% of these are from South Sudan and now live in the remote Gambella region of western Ethiopia. Although safe from the conflict and insecurity that forced them to flee, many refugees are still suffering from their effects, including acute malnutrition and trauma related to violence. With limited local options for self-sustainability and little chance of returning home in the near future, most refugee households remain reliant on ongoing international assistance to meet their basic needs.With GAC's support, Concern Worldwide is providing nutritional assistance to an estimated 19,500 South Sudanese refugees and host communities in the Gambella region of Ethiopia. Activities include: (1) targeted therapeutic feeding of acutely malnourished children; (2) blanket supplementary feeding for households with vulnerable children; and (3) the provision of inputs to enhance dietary diversity amongst benficiary households. / Mars 2018 – L'Éthiopie accueille le deuxième plus important contingent de réfugiés en Afrique, soit près d'un million de personnes. Environ 40 % des réfugiés proviennent du Soudan du Sud et vivent aujourd'hui dans la région éloignée de Gambella, dans l'Ouest de l'Éthiopie. Même s'ils sont maintenant à l'abri du conflit et de l'insécurité qui les ont forcés à fuir leur pays, bon nombre de réfugiés en ressentent encore des effets (malnutrition aiguë, traumatismes liés à la violence, etc.). Compte tenu du nombre limité d'options à l'échelle locale en matière d'autosuffisance et de leurs faibles chances de revenir à la maison dans un avenir rapproché, la plupart des ménages de réfugiés continuent de dépendre de l'aide internationale pour satisfaire leurs besoins de base.Grâce au soutien d'AMC, Concern Worldwide fournit une aide nutritionnelle à environ 19 500 réfugiés du Soudan du Sud et membres des collectivités d'accueil dans la région de Gambella, en Éthiopie. Les activités du projet comprennent : (1) la distribution ciblée d'aliments thérapeutiques aux enfants souffrant de malnutrition aiguë; (2) la distribution de suppléments alimentaires aux ménages ayant des enfants vulnérables; et (3) la prestation de conseils pour améliorer la nutritionnelle chez les ménages ciblés.",1.205727

Action Against Hunger: Humanitarian Support 2018-2020. ACTION AGAINST HUNGER: HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT 2018-2020. At the beginning of 2018, 135 million people found themselves in a situation in which they will urgently need humanitarian assistance, and 815 million people – one in nine – still go to bed on an empty stomach each night. Each year Sida undertakes a humanitarian allocation process in which all on-going humanitarian crises are analyzed against a number of objective indicators (e.g. number of people in need), and where the partners most relevant to respond to identified needs in each specific crisis are selected. This is to ensure a real application of the humanitarian principles, and especially the principle of impartiality. The initial funding to Action Against Hunger (AAH) in 2018, which is being encompassed in this decision, is thus based on the Sida humanitarian allocation process that took place in late 2017. A three-year agreement is suggested to be signed with AAH, where additional contributions will be added to the agreement, subject to funds availability, governmental appropriations and Sida needs assessments. A three-year agreement does also allow for strategic multi-year projects, which will increase the possibility to reach durable solutions.For 2018, it is proposed that 180 MSEK is allocated to AAH for the implementation of activities in 18 countries and to support the Rapid Response Mechanism and the SMART Methodology. An additional 21 MSEK is added to the agreement, 13 MSEK and 8 MSEK for activities to be implemented in 2019 and 2020, respectively, which means that the total initial contribution to AAH amounts to 201 MSEK. For a detailed overview of the allocated support to AAH, please see Annex V (Budget summary) to the agreement.AAH is a non-profit organization, previously known as Action Contre La Faim (ACF), which is governed by the French Association Law of July 1, 1901. AAH was founded in 1979 with an explicit goal of responding to humanitarian emergencies, with a main focus on issues relating to malnutrition. The mission of AAH is to reduce and prevent hunger among the most vulnerable populations around the world. Its mandate is to save lives by eliminating hunger through preventing, detecting and treating malnutrition, and to address the underlying causes of hunger.",0.696454

To further accelerate the rate of reduction of early neonatal mortality and intrapartum stillbirths a simplified neonatal resuscitation protocol: Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) has been developed, which has been shown to reduce intra-partum deaths by about 50%. There is however a need to evaluate different implementation strategies that promote retention of resuscitation skills and facilitate translation of knowledge into clinical practice, and to scale-up such implementation strategies.  We have previously successfully completed an implementation trial of HBB at a tertiary hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. The HBB protocol was complemented by a Quality Improvement Cycle strategy (QIC) and displayed good retention of skills and significant changes in clinical practice. We now propose a scale-up study at district level of the HBB-QIC concept. The research project till apply a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled design at eight (8) district hospital in different regions of Nepal. To ensure good health and survival for all is at the core of the development research agenda and this project addresses a neglected area with great potential for improvement. With a successful scale-up strategy the HBB-QIC concept can potentially have far-reaching consequences and make a huge contribution to the efforts to reduce the burden of intrapartum deaths.",0.126905

DKT International - DKT - Access to safe and legal abortions. DKT INTERNATIONAL - DKT - ACCESS TO SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTIONS. DKT International (US-based non-for-profit) have submitted an application for a regional programme to contribute to improved sexual and reproductive health and rights in six countries in the region (Tanzania, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, DRC, Mozambique). Focus is on decreasing the number of unwanted pregnancies and the availability to safe abortion. By increasing peoples access to a wide range of contraceptives, like IUD and implants, one contributes to their opportunities to decide over their own bodies and fertility. The programme is also specifically focused on young people through efforts to reduce teenage pregnancies and this is intended to help reduce the maternal mortality rates. The programme will also complement the programmes implemented through existing health systems and the public sector which often suffers from lack of resources. This complementing programme with the private sector is intended to contribute to reduced poverty and in the end support economic development. The six countries have demographical similarities when it comes to the large number of Young people, high maternal mortality rates and a huge unmet need for information and health services related to sexual and reproductive health and rights. Access to and the use of modern contraceptives (Contraceptive Prevalence Rates - CPR) is for example in Uganda only 8%. In Ethiopia, which is the second most populated country in Africa with approximately 100 million people, more than 66% are young below 25 years. In Tanzania more than 50% are below the age of 18 and the trend is similar in the remaining countries. There is therefore a great potential to increase the market in the region on access to contraceptives and especially among young people given the demographic similarities. There is also a big potential to build on already ongoing initiatives and existing programmes which DKT is implementing in these six countries.  This regional programme is planned to complement programmes at bilateral in those countries where Sida is working on SRHR. Initial discussions have been held with the Embassies in Kinshasa, Maputo and Dar es Salam. Continuous consultations will be held with these as well as with the Embassies in Kampala and Addis Ababa. There are also clear Connections to Sidas global programme support to strategic partners such as IPAS and IPPF who are also working on SRHR, contraceptives and abortion. Synergies will be explored throughout the programme and there is also a firm interest from DKT International to look at potential connections and collaborations at bilateral level as well as with Sidas partners at global level,of which many are already established collaborating partners with DKT International. DKT International are well established as one of the worlds' main organisations with expertise in Contraceptive Social Marketing (CSM).

Development of oral eflornithine for late-stage African sleeping sickness. DEVELOPMENT OF ORAL EFLORNITHINE FOR LATE-STAGE AFRICAN SLEEPING SICKNESS. Eflornithine is one of only three main-stay drugs registered for the treatment of late-stage human African trypanosomiasis, a uniformly fatal disease if left untreated. Eflornithine is currently recommended as a first line treatment, but due to its complicated intravenous administration, numerous patients are left untreated. A simplified mode of administration would enable more patients having access to treatment. Eflornithine is available as a racemate, a 50:50 mixture of its complementary stereoisomers. L-eflornithine is about 10-20-fold more potent but its absorption after oral dose is less favoured compared with D-eflornithine. The project will explore by non-clinical in vitro, in vivo and pharmacometric methods, a simplified, oral treatment alternative for eflornithine chemotherapy in late-stage T.b. gambiense sleeping sickness by seeking ways to improve the oral absorption of L-eflornithine.",0.035251

This programme is implemented during a five-year period (as framework organizations may now apply for grants for longer periods than in the past in order to increase aid effectiveness) and it is based on Diakonia's global strategy for 2015-2020. It includes 21 country programs in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, and six regional programs and a new global program for innovation in the area of  social and economic justice.  Diakonia is working through local civil society organizations for the overall goal to change unfair structures that generate and uphold inequality, oppression and violence and to work for fulfilment of the right of all people to live a life in dignity. In total 216 partner organizations are included in this application. Operations are focused on the following six areas: human rights (HR), democracy, equality, social and economic justice, conflict and justice, as well as capacity development of partners. What is new compared to the previous contribution is primarily the inclusion of several new regional programs in various areas as well as the global innovation program.Expected results:General expected results are formulated for the six areas. These are linked to the expected results for each program (i.e. by country / regional / global program), which in many cases consist of a selection of results that are identical to the general results. The results at the program level are concretized through indicators.Examples of expected outcomes, one from each region, in some common thematic areas are: Mali: Women's political participation has been strengthened at the local and national levels  (democracy) Bolivia: Gender-based violence has decreased  (gender equality) Bangladesh: The conditions for decent work and fair income have improved  (social and economic justice) Lebanon: The capacity of Diakonia's partners to integrate environment and conflict sensitivity in their work (where relevant) has been improved.  (capacity development)Previous results:Reports often show results in terms of strengthened rights holders and increased capacity of partner organizations.The following examples show previous results in a few areas:Human rights: In Thailand five partner organizations assisted tens of thousands of stateless persons to obtain legal status. This means that they for example have the right to work and study, as well as to access rights-based services.Democracy: In Mali, partner organizations were trained in citizen budget monitoring and analysis of public policies. This has led to increased budgets for health and education in several municipalities. In one province all municipalities published their accounting in 2014, whereas in 2012 none of the municipalities did.Conflict and Justice: Seven partner organizations in Colombia, Honduras and Peru have increased their knowledge of the legal framework and have taken legal action, which in some cases resulted in the return to communities of pieces of land from extractive c",0.08915

ACTION AGAINST HUNGER: HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT 2018-2020. At the beginning of 2018, 135 million people found themselves in a situation in which they will urgently need humanitarian assistance, and 815 million people – one in nine – still go to bed on an empty stomach each night. Each year Sida undertakes a humanitarian allocation process in which all on-going humanitarian crises are analyzed against a number of objective indicators (e.g. number of people in need), and where the partners most relevant to respond to identified needs in each specific crisis are selected. This is to ensure a real application of the humanitarian principles, and especially the principle of impartiality. The initial funding to Action Against Hunger (AAH) in 2018, which is being encompassed in this decision, is thus based on the Sida humanitarian allocation process that took place in late 2017. A three-year agreement is suggested to be signed with AAH, where additional contributions will be added to the agreement, subject to funds availability, governmental appropriations and Sida needs assessments. A three-year agreement does also allow for strategic multi-year projects, which will increase the possibility to reach durable solutions.For 2018, it is proposed that 180 MSEK is allocated to AAH for the implementation of activities in 18 countries and to support the Rapid Response Mechanism and the SMART Methodology. An additional 21 MSEK is added to the agreement, 13 MSEK and 8 MSEK for activities to be implemented in 2019 and 2020, respectively, which means that the total initial contribution to AAH amounts to 201 MSEK. For a detailed overview of the allocated support to AAH, please see Annex V (Budget summary) to the agreement.AAH is a non-profit organization, previously known as Action Contre La Faim (ACF), which is governed by the French Association Law of July 1, 1901. AAH was founded in 1979 with an explicit goal of responding to humanitarian emergencies, with a main focus on issues relating to malnutrition. The mission of AAH is to reduce and prevent hunger among the most vulnerable populations around the world. Its mandate is to save lives by eliminating hunger through preventing, detecting and treating malnutrition, and to address the underlying causes of hunger.",0.957624

Outdoor and household air pollution-exposure and effects on pregnant women in Africa. OUTDOOR AND HOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION-EXPOSURE AND EFFECTS ON PREGNANT WOMEN IN AFRICA. In 2012, one in eight deaths worldwide resulted from air pollution. For Africa lack of data is a barrier to estimate effects. Satellite images indicate detrimental levels, but monitoring and high resolution outdoor air pollution modelling is lacking. Household air pollution is also a major source of exposure, more knowledge on how different cook stoves, fuels and habits affect exposure is crucial. No high quality study of the effect of outdoor and indoor air pollution on pregnant women in Africa has so far been conducted.   We will investigate consequences of air pollution in a prospective cohort of women recruited during pregnancy at public health facilities in Ethiopia. Outdoor air pollution will be assessed by high quality modelling which combines measurements with Geographical Information System tools and aerial and topographical imaging. Individual exposure will be linked to the model by residential address. Indoor exposure will be assessed by questionnaires and validated by measurements. Emission factors from different fuels and cooking methods, and particle characteristics will be assessed in our Aerosol Lab in Lund. Data on pregnancy outcomes, exposures and confounders will be compiled and epidemiological studies on the effect of outdoor and household air pollution on pregnancy complications will be done.   This study, which will increase knowledge of not only health impact but also of source characteristics, will provide important knowledge for appropriate policy making.",0.042302

SAYWHAT YOUTHS ACTION FOR CHOICE 2018-2021. The Students and Youth Working on reproductive Health Action Team (SAYWHAT) is registered under the Private and Voluntary Organisation Act (PVO 34/2017). The organisation was formed in 2003 to provide a conducive platform to deliberate on students unmet Sexual and Reproductive Health need. The platform is also a mechanism through which students and youths coordinate themselves to inform Sexual and Reproductive Health and public health policies, programs and practise. Over the years, SAYWHAT has proved to be a dynamic and innovative space, attracting recognition and partnerships from college authorities, the government of Zimbabwe, international and national funding and implementing partners, the Southern African Development Committee, and the Africa Union on matters relating to Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights of students.Background of the contributionAccording to the 2012 Census, about 60% of Zimbabweans are below the age of 24 and this scenario presents socio-economic challenges ranging from inadequacies in health service provision, quality education and unemployment amongst other development facet priorities for young people. The Ministry of Health and Child Care in 2010 launched an Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health Strategy which sought to operationalize provisions of the Reproductive Health Policy regarding young people's access to comprehensive sexuality education and related services in a Youth Friendly manner. The Strategy was intended to be co-implemented with the Ministries of Youth, Primary and Secondary Education, Higher and Tertiary Education. Sub-sequent reviews in 2013 and 2016 showed that the Ministries have not fully implemented the ASRH Strategy, thus intended benefits have not accrued to young people in schools (Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education), young people out of schools (Ministry of Youth) and young people in Higher Education (Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education).The Ministry of Health has rolled out the Sex and Sexuality Life Skills Strategy but most health indicators remain negative for young people with their HIV Prevalence standing at 10% in the 15 – 24-year age group. The Zimbabwe Demographic Health Survey 2015/16 has showed a general decline of HIV Incidence, mortality and morbidity in the reproductive age of 15 – 45 years. However, such has not been enjoyed by young people who still have more than 50% of the new infections, high rates of poor adherence to ART and a higher HIV Mortality rate.The Adolescent Fertility Study of 2016 showed that the Unmet Contraception need for adolescents is at 12,8% and the Contraception Prevalence rate in the same age group is at 10%. The current fertility rate amongst adolescents and young people 15 – 24 is 27% in rural areas and 10% in urban areas. Child bearing has a significant impact on young people's access to quality education, and exposes them to other vulnerabilities such as STIs and Cervical Cancer.

Sida has assessed the UN High Commissioner for Refugees as a relevant and strategic humanitarian partner with good implementation capacity. Sida's Central Organisational Assessment of UNHCR (2015) concludes that the organisation's systems for internal control are adequate according and in line with Sida contribution regulations. Sida provides support, in addition to the MFA's annual core contribution, based on the UN Consolidated Appeals (HRP) and UNHCRs Global Appeal, Supplementary Budget Appeals and UNHCR Regional Response Plans (RRRP). Sida allocates funding to UNHCR on a country / regional level and support is unearmarked at this level. During the year Sida assesses UNHCR's Supplementary Appeals for possible additional funding through supplementary decisions.With its mandate, to protect refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people, and assist in their voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement to a third country, UNHCR is alongside ICRC Sida's key protection partner. In addition to its operational role in the protection of refugees, UNHCR has a normative role in monitoring and interpreting the Refugee Convention. UNHCR is the lead Agency in Refugee operations within the humanitarian system with responsibility to coordinate UN agencies and NGOs response in refugee crisis. This includes coordination of several regional refugee appeals such as Syria, Horn of Africa, Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen, CAR, Burundi and Europe.UNHCR coordinates its response under OCHA in emergency within countries (internally displaced people). UNHCR is responsible for leading and coordinating the Protection Cluster, the clusters of Camp Coordination and Camp Management, as well as the Emergency Shelter cluster. UNHCR is thereby contributing strategically to the humanitarian system, at global, regional and country level.Through this support Sida contributes humanitarian funding to UNHCR in order to assist refugees and internally displaced people in armed conflict, providing legal protection from persecution and violence, emergency shelter (tents, semi-permanent structures, rent for temporary accommodation) and basic necessities (such as food, water, hygiene and primary health care, etc), as well as opportunities for durable solutions, when the situation so allows.

Further improvement of skills for in-service maternity care staff will be performed, to ensure the skills of already trained midwives are up-to-date. One Swedish academic institution with expertise in midwifery will be relied upon to fulfill a quality assurance function, to ensure the academic trainig provided as well as the continued development of the midwives is in line with the internation standards established by WHO as well as the International Midwifery Council (IMC). The strengthening of human resources for maternity and neonatal care will be accompanied by improvements in physical infrastructure for delivery care, by providing basic maternity equipment as well lighting (using solar energy) in maternities in need. Conditions for better sanitation and hygiene will also be enhanced at a number of maternity wards. Behavioural change in communities will be boosted by a number of activities to fight negative cultural attitudes, raise awareness on available services and to promote utilization of services, including family planning. The project will support the conversion of 240 nurses into midwives and will rehabilitate and provide basic maternity equipment, including lighting system using solar energy and water sytems to 100 maternities (in hospitals and health centers). The project is expected to contribute to an annual increase of utilization of maternal, neonatal, child and adolescent health (MNCAH) services by 3 % and to reduce maternal mortality rate by 7% by 2021.",0.793156

The overall objective of the program is to strengthen the resilience of people and communities to crises, and their capacity to recover afterwards, and to reduce the risk that people and communities are affected by crises and disasters. A novelty of the new agreement period is that three country-projects (Afghanistan, DR Congo and Myanmar) are offered multiyear financing as they are protracted crises with a need for preidictable finansing to secure necessary resources and ensure predictability and contextspecific impact.Funds allocated for 2017 will be disbursed in two different payments, after signature of the agreement and after 1 September 2017, following approval of implementation of the action plan established by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies regarding internal management and control. Funds allocated for Ukraine and for a scaled up response in South Sudan (from a budget of 4,5 MSEK to13,5 MSEK) will be disbursed after the SRC has provided Sida with, and Sida's approval of, additional applications for these contexts, and after the SRC has demonstrated in written that the corruption case in Ukraine has been investigated and closed and after Sida's approval of the investigation and its recommendations. The SRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement made up of 190 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Federation (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

The SRC's strategic cooperation with partners within the movement - with other National Societies (NS), IFRC and the ICRC – is essential and gives the SRC the possibility to work at both global and local levels. The SRC is in addition considered to have systems, expertise and capacity to strengthen the local capacity of NS to predict and prevent disasters, as well as to contribute to rapid humanitarian assistance in sudden crises. The SRC has faced difficulties in demonstrating the humanitarian relevance of the Sida-funded programs as they are often situated between humanitarian action and long-term development.

Action Against Hunger: Humanitarian Support 2018-2020. ACTION AGAINST HUNGER: HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT 2018-2020. At the beginning of 2018, 135 million people found themselves in a situation in which they will urgently need humanitarian assistance, and 815 million people – one in nine – still go to bed on an empty stomach each night. Each year Sida undertakes a humanitarian allocation process in which all on-going humanitarian crises are analyzed against a number of objective indicators (e.g. number of people in need), and where the partners most relevant to respond to identified needs in each specific crisis are selected. This is to ensure a real application of the humanitarian principles, and especially the principle of impartiality. The initial funding to Action Against Hunger (AAH) in 2018, which is being encompassed in this decision, is thus based on the Sida humanitarian allocation process that took place in late 2017. A three-year agreement is suggested to be signed with AAH, where additional contributions will be added to the agreement, subject to funds availability, governmental appropriations and Sida needs assessments. A three-year agreement does also allow for strategic multi-year projects, which will increase the possibility to reach durable solutions.For 2018, it is proposed that 180 MSEK is allocated to AAH for the implementation of activities in 18 countries and to support the Rapid Response Mechanism and the SMART Methodology. An additional 21 MSEK is added to the agreement, 13 MSEK and 8 MSEK for activities to be implemented in 2019 and 2020, respectively, which means that the total initial contribution to AAH amounts to 201 MSEK. For a detailed overview of the allocated support to AAH, please see Annex V (Budget summary) to the agreement.AAH is a non-profit organization, previously known as Action Contre La Faim (ACF), which is governed by the French Association Law of July 1, 1901. AAH was founded in 1979 with an explicit goal of responding to humanitarian emergencies, with a main focus on issues relating to malnutrition. The mission of AAH is to reduce and prevent hunger among the most vulnerable populations around the world. Its mandate is to save lives by eliminating hunger through preventing, detecting and treating malnutrition, and to address the underlying causes of hunger.",0.847672

Hungry Cities Initiative: Informality, Inclusive Growth, and Food Security in Cities of the Global South. HUNGRY CITIES INITIATIVE: INFORMALITY, INCLUSIVE GROWTH, AND FOOD SECURITY IN CITIES OF THE GLOBAL SOUTH. As urban populations grow in developing countries, promoting inclusive growth that ensures food security for all is critical. This project will offer new insights into the informal food sector, and identify entrepreneurship and job opportunities for women and youth.Growth in urban populations The urban population in developing countries is expected to exceed 50% for the first time by 2020. Over the next 30 years, these cities will absorb 95% of urban growth. By 2030, they will be home to almost 4 billion people, or 80% of the world's urban population. As people move to the cities, there is a growing crisis of food insecurity. Food prices are high and incomes are low. Even in countries experiencing rapid economic growth, food insecurity is a major challenge. Within this context, the urban food economy is an important laboratory for examining whether and how inclusive growth strategies can have a positive impact by encouraging entrepreneurship, raising incomes, alleviating poverty, and mitigating the crisis of food insecurity.The Hungry Cities InitiativeThe goal of the Hungry Cities Initiative is to promote inclusive growth in the informal food sector through research on policy approaches that enable it, combined with measures that support entrepreneurship and decent employment. The Hungry Cities Initiative seeks to provide a global perspective on the links between three major transformation processes: rapid urbanization, the crisis of food insecurity, and the informal economy's emergence as the major source of livelihood for urban poor, including women and youth.The African Centre for Cities at the University of Cape Town (South Africa) and the Balsillie School of International Affairs at Wilfrid Laurier University (Canada) run the Hungry Cities Initiative. They work with five other Canadian universities, together with researchers and municipal governments in seven cities in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.How this research will make a differenceThe research team will analyze formal and informal urban food systems in the partner cities, how they interact, how they are governed, and their respective contribution to food security and inclusive growth.This project will:-provide evidence of entrepreneurial challenges and opportunities in the urban informal food system;-identify potential opportunities for women and youth to be incorporated as entrepreneurs and employees with decent jobs;-deliver knowledge through workshops, training, and consultations to inform policy and practice at the municipal level on enterprise development, entrepreneurship, and innovation in the informal food economy;-support 24 students (one post-doctoral, three PhD and 20 master's students) to develop research and collaborate with their Canadian peers; and-offer six policy workshops on urban food security and inclusive growth.The International Partnerships for Sustainable Societies program is funding this project.

HEALTH WORKERS' INCENTIVES IN SOUTH SUDAN (IMCHA). South Sudan has some of the worst health indicators in the world. This project will seek to address the problem by improving community health-worker motivation and performance. This, in turn, will help improve maternal and child health outcomes.Access to health care in South SudanFifty-five percent of South Sudanese live beyond walking distance to a health clinic. Poverty, limited infrastructure, lack of health information, severe shortages of health personnel, and lack of up-to-date standards of practice are seriously compromising healthcare services. The Ministry of Health and BRAC South Sudan (a non-governmental organization) are using the support of community health workers to address the gap and extend existing health interventions to underserved communities. There is a need to improve the performance of the country's 3,000 community health workers and to sustain their services using approaches that work.Reducing deaths, improving healthThis project will provide information on sustainable methods of delivering community-based primary healthcare services in emergency settings. The project team will examine non-financial incentives that will help improve the performance of community health workers. The study's first phase includes analyzing a qualitative evaluation of existing community health-worker programs in South Sudan and other BRAC-supported countries (Uganda, Sierra Leone, and Liberia). During the second phase, a randomized controlled trial will assess whether non-financial incentives are effective enough to sustain support of community health workers in South Sudan.The findings from this project will address gaps in knowledge for cost-effective measures, such as non-financial incentives, to improve access to health care for mothers and children in high conflict contexts. The results will directly inform, strengthen, and scale community health-worker program efforts implemented by BRAC and the Ministry of Health in South Sudan. The research team will share its findings through scientific publications and presentations.Project partnersThis project is part of the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa program.

Enabling Business and Technologies to Contribute to the Control of Mosquito-Borne Diseases in Latin America. ENABLING BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONTROL OF MOSQUITO-BORNE DISEASES IN LATIN AMERICA. Aedes mosquito-transmitted illnesses, namely dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, have become a major burden of disease in Latin America and the Caribbean, where vector control programs have not been able to reduce the risk of disease transmission.IDRC and the Sao Paulo Research Foundation have partnered to promote and assess the role of small businesses in the development of new Aedes mosquito control technologies. Two research studies will take place in Mexico, where 60% of the territory, representing more than 50 million people, presents favorable conditions for the incidence of the Aedes mosquito. These studies will generate scientific evidence to support house screening as an effective and affordable vector tool in the city of Merida. It will also assess the efficacy, acceptability, and biosecurity of a paint that has the effect of prolonged residual insecticide in the city of Pochutla. Local partners Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán and CodeQuim, a vector control company, will implement the project. Senior researchers, small businesses, decision-makers and community representatives will be involved in both studies. Cost-effectiveness studies will assess the affordability of the proposed vector control tools. Subject to results, both the house screening and insecticide paint are promising tools to be applied in the context of integrated vector management. They are expected to contribute to national and/or state-level public health efforts to reduce the risk of Aedes-transmitted diseases and to be replicated in other Mexican cities. The project will document lessons learned about the role of small business in enhancing community access to vector control tools and assess the factors that influence their capacity to develop and speed up the time-to-market of Aedes control technologies.",0.104898

The impact of tobacco pricing and packaging strategies in middle-income countries. THE IMPACT OF TOBACCO PRICING AND PACKAGING STRATEGIES IN MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES. International evidence, primarily from high-income countries, has clearly shown that higher cigarette prices reduce tobacco use, with greater reductions among young people and those from socio-economically disadvantaged groups. There is also a growing body of evidence that has observed positive impacts of plain packaging measures, especially in high-income country settings. However, the same cannot be concluded for low- and middle-income countries. Reviews that looked at how tobacco prices or taxes affected smoking in these countries did not produce conclusive evidence due to pervasive data and methodological limitations among reviewed studies. To fill these gaps and respond to the policymakers' demand for this evidence, this project will study the impact of tobacco prices on smoking onset, consumption, and cessation in Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, South Africa, and Vietnam. The effects of both tax and retail price will be further analyzed according to their effect by socioeconomic status, sex, and age, with simulations to determine the ultimate impacts on tax revenue, tobacco use, and health outcomes. Additionally, the impact of cigarette packaging and major recent country-specific policy changes will be analyzed. These analyses will also provide improved understanding of women's and girls' responsiveness to tobacco control measures. This knowledge is especially important to address the marketing strategies targeting vulnerable groups in low- and middle-income countries. Cross-border and cross-regional comparisons between countries with differing socioeconomic inequalities and policy environments will enhance the relevance of the findings to a wide variety of markets and strengthen the case for change when these countries review their policies.This project was selected for funding under the Global Alliance for Chronic Diseases' Lung Disease Call 2016, and is being parallel-funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and IDRC. The two Canadian institutions jointly designed their call to focus exclusively on tobacco control, disease prevention, and health equity, which are development priorities for both.",0.058403

Enhancing community health workers support for maternal, adolescent and newborn health project plus contraception in rural Tanzania (IMCHA). ENHANCING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS SUPPORT FOR MATERNAL, ADOLESCENT AND NEWBORN HEALTH PROJECT PLUS CONTRACEPTION IN RURAL TANZANIA (IMCHA). Access to the means of preventing unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions is critical for averting maternal and newborn deaths and disease. One out of every five Tanzanians is an adolescent, and by the age of 19, half of all girls are pregnant or have already given birth to a child. While contraceptive use by adolescents has increased, less than one in every six adolescents uses contraceptive methods. There are severe limitations in access to family planning services in rural Tanzania, particularly in the districts surrounding Lake Victoria.   This project, a collaboration between the Bruyère Research Institute and Shirati KMT Council Designated Hospital, will complement a current project to build an enhanced cadre of community health workers in rural Tanzania by integrating a focus on the reproductive health needs of women. The project will train community health workers (CHWs) to educate adolescents and women about family planning options, including safe sexual behaviors, and help improve access to family planning services using mobile health applications. Nurses will be trained to work with these CHWs to provide enhanced family planning methods and prevent stock shortages by using m-health stock monitoring of family planning items.A mixed methods approach will be used to measure the effectiveness and impact of the interventions under this project. Quantitative measurements of contraceptive use (from baseline and post-intervention) will be undertaken using m-health measures of stock levels and work flows of CHWs. Qualitative data from focus group discussions with women, CHWs, and nurses, as well as participatory research activities with policymakers, will ensure a better understanding of the cultural aspects of reproductive health and needs from women and adolescents. Involvement of regional and district medical officers in planning and regular engagement of policymakers at local, regional, and national levels will increase awareness and integration of knowledge in policy and programming.This project is funded by the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa program.

This project is part of the 2019 United Nations-coordinated Humanitarian Response Plan for the West Bank and Gaza Strip and responds to the Ministerial priority of humanitarian action to reach the poorest and most vulnerable. Projects under this appeal help to reduce the vulnerability of Palestinians, especially women and children, affected by the ongoing crisis. In line with humanitarian principles, projects are selected based on priority needs, but special attention will be paid to choosing projects that support gender equality, women and girls, and address sexual and reproductive health and rights.In particular, this project will seek to improve the resilience and food security of agricultural households, including agriculture-dependent female-headed households in the West Bank (975 individuals, of which 435 female and 540 male), by providing time-critical and quick impact support to address their needs. This will involve supporting improved livestock practices and techniques, including in crop management, livestock feeding and disease control to increase efficiency and profitability of household production. It will also involve ensuring an increase in the availability and access to sustainable agricultural and water resources for farmers in targeted communities, as well as the provision of cash for work opportunities for 300 households.The project will also seek to improve access to safe, affordable water and good hygiene to the vulnerable community of Wadi Al Salqa (over 7,995 individuals, of which at least 3965 female and 4030 male) in Gaza. In doing so, the project will support intermediate WASH solutions and providing technical assistance to the municipality on the provision of WASH services. It will alsodistribute 800 hygiene kits with special consideration for the hygiene needs of women and girls. Finally, the project will also provide case management and referral services to approximately 60 survivors of GBV and deliver awareness-raising activities in relation to GBV in the community. / À venir",0.772419

CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE FOR CRVS SYSTEMS ACTIVITY BUDGET LINE: STRENGTHENING COUNTRY LEVEL EVIDENCE, CAPACITY AND EXCHANGE. Systematic registration of vital and civil events - including birth, death, causes of death, marriage, and divorce - is critical for improving maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health. Integrated into existing health information systems, these statistics become valuable evidence, giving policymakers and practitioners the knowledge they need to review the circumstances leading to each maternal and child death, identify preventable factors, and take action where needed. However, such crucial information systems are lacking in many countries. It is estimated that one-third of the world's births and two-thirds of the world's deaths are not registered or are incorrectly certified. Where global norms, standards, tools, and promising practices exist, they are not readily accessible and usable to those who need them most. Funded by Global Affairs Canada and IDRC, and housed at IDRC, the Centre of Excellence for Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) Systems will link knowledge seekers with information, tools, and expertise to facilitate the development and implementation of integrated CRVS systems. The Centre of Excellence will coordinate with existing expert groups to generate, consolidate and disseminate information, including by developing an open-access, electronic platform to make key resources readily accessible. It will facilitate exchange of good practices and capacity strengthening, and will play an important role brokering technical assistance for countries needing more direct support. This project will allow the Centre of Excellence to support countries in accessing the technical expertise they need to develop and implement effective CRVS systems. This includes developing and maintaining a roster of experts for the Centre of Excellence and CRVS stakeholders at the country level to draw on as appropriate. The project will also allow the Centre of Excellence to contract expert advice and accompaniment, convene and/or participate in stakeholder meetings, as well as undertake CRVS systems gap analysis and priority setting analysis. In addition to facilitating access to technical expertise, the RSP will enable specific training for country representatives working to develop and/or implement their CRVS systems plans and it will structure peer learning opportunities to address specific gaps at the country level. The Centre of Excellence will also support locally based institutions in countries eligible for financing from the Global Financing Facility to ensure in-country CRVS systems expertise for sustainability.",0.002566

MOTHER-CHILD HEALTH IN LACOR-SOUTH SUDAN (IMCHA). Implementing comprehensive, community-focused primary health care is a major challenge in post-conflict regions such as South Sudan and neighbouring Northern Uganda. South Sudan is recovering from two decades of civil war that have destroyed education and health infrastructure. Torit Hospital, one of the major hospitals in the region, is poorly staffed and lacks specialists and basic equipment. The situation is similar in Northern Uganda. In the District of Gulu, the burden of disease has largely been managed through St. Mary's Hospital Lacor. This region has not been able to achieve the progress in maternal and child health that has been reached in the central part of Uganda.This project assesses the implementation and scale of community-focused reproductive and child health interventions in post-conflict settings. It focuses on establishing evidence to promote sustainability and resilience, with the goal of ensuring access to essential health services by vulnerable populations. The researchers will explore strategies for improved maternal care and child nutrition services, cervical cancer screening, and support for women's empowerment through outreach efforts from the two hospitals. Research findings will be validated through ministries of health at the local, district, and national levels to optimize engagement and to encourage adoption of the project's recommendations to strengthen systems. The results of the study will directly inform the ministries of health in South Sudan and in Uganda on related interventions, including a scalable model for improved community-based services. This will address barriers to interventions, reduce maternal and child mortality, and extend the reach of health services to communities that have faced shocks and stressors.This is part of the Innovating for Maternal and Child Health in Africa (IMCHA) initiative, a seven year, $CA36 million multi-donor partnership funded by Global Affairs Canada, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and Canada's International Development Research Centre.Objectives /",0.007533

Understanding and addressing the sexual and reproductive health needs and challenges of young refugee girls and women in Nigeria and Uganda. UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING THE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH NEEDS AND CHALLENGES OF YOUNG REFUGEE GIRLS AND WOMEN IN NIGERIA AND UGANDA. More people than ever are affected by emergencies due to conflicts and natural disasters. Young women and girls are particularly at risk for sexual violence and unsafe abortion, early and forced marriage, early and unintended childbearing, trafficking, and sexual exploitation. An estimated 35 million women and girls of reproductive age (15–49 years) living in humanitarian emergencies have urgent needs for sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) information and services. However, forced displacements and conflicts strain health systems and cause significant disruptions in access to these critical services.The goal of this project is to generate and use evidence to improve the design and delivery of SRHR services among young girls and women in selected refugee camps in Uganda and Nigeria. This group is often underserved in relation to SRHR services and information. Compared to older women, they are less likely to be aware of or to have ever used a contraceptive method. The project will adopt a multidisciplinary approach, using the ecological model in health promotion to define the challenges and practical solutions underlying adolescent SRHR in Nigeria and Uganda. Working hand-in-hand, the research and program implementing organizations will contribute to a better understanding of the needs for adolescent sexual and reproductive health services and rights, and improved sexual and reproductive health and rights services for internally displaced and refugee girls and young women.

Faced with one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, Nigeria has identified maternal and child health as a priority issue. This project will help address the problem through research that assesses the reception, cost, and impact of home visits. It will also examine how video 'edutainment' (educational entertainment) and other tools can influence maternal and infant outcomes.Women at riskWomen at highest risk in Nigeria are those who are least able to attend health facilities to receive conventional antenatal care during pregnancy. Typically, they are socially isolated, overworked, impoverished, subjected to gender violence, and poorly educated.Community action and education have a central role to play in ensuring that mothers and their infants have access to health care. Pilot project for better outcomesThis project will test and implement universal home visits that address these gaps across pilot sites in Nigeria as a strategy to improve maternal and child health. The methodology involves a large-scale cluster randomized controlled trial to measure the impact of strategies for implementing home visits and video education tools (video edutainment) within the country's health services. The project team will engage government officials to maximize opportunities to integrate home visits into health services for pregnant women and their spouses in randomly selected wards of the Toro Local Government Authority. The goal is to scale up these approaches at the national level.The project will offer a better understanding of how home visits and video education during pregnancy can influence health outcomes.

Overcoming obstacles to adoption of Brazil's national Dietary Guidelines. OVERCOMING OBSTACLES TO ADOPTION OF BRAZIL'S NATIONAL DIETARY GUIDELINES. The increased production, availability, marketing, and consumption of ultra-processed food and drink products have profoundly changed food systems and are leading causes of today's pandemics of obesity and non-communicable diseases. Brazil has developed a classification system of foods based on the nature, extent, and purpose of industrial processing, and has adopted it as the basis of the Ministry of Health's 2014 Dietary Guidelines for the Brazilian Population. These guidelines provide a framework and an opportunity to strengthen regulatory action and public policies to improve diets by changing the nation's food system. A collaboration with local partner the Brazilian Institute for Consumer Protection, this project will identify and test public policies and market practices that can overcome the obstacles to healthy diets identified in the guidelines in the areas of information, culinary skills, supply, marketing, and price policies. Studies of national policies on food labeling, salt and sugar reduction, food prices, and marketing will be complemented with community-education studies and evaluation of local retail environments. The ultimate goal is to improve population health and environmental sustainability by creating tools that can transform the food environment, locally and nationally, in ways that improve the ability of Brazilians to follow the dietary guidelines and adopt healthy diets. Studies will include assessing the impact on the most vulnerable populations and on the sustainability of the food supply. The Brazilian Guidelines are considered unique and innovative.

Equity and Social Determinants of Health in Health Information Systems to inform Policies and Guide Reproductive Health Programs. EQUITY AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO INFORM POLICIES AND GUIDE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PROGRAMS. The research will promote greater disaggregation of health information and inclusion of gender and social determinants of health indicators in Health Information Systems (HIS) at the national level in Egypt, Jordan and Morocco. Through this, the project aims to address the data gaps in measuring inequality and the hurdles to using such data for pro-poor policy change in the these countries. The project will support both policy level changes and guide program implementation in these three countries. The project will also comprise support for capacity strengthening of relevant policy and HIS stakeholders to promote the generation and use of disaggregated health information in policies and programs. The proposed HIS will inform implementation by engaging with programs addressing specific sexual and reproductive health (SRH) challenges. Project results will include two packages of HIS indicators for each of the three countries. A core set of indicators to highlight greater disaggregation of health information from a multisectoral perspective. The second will support reproductive health programs to incorporate missing social dimensions of health and equity, including gender, in planning and implementation of interventions. Relevant action plans, monitoring and evaluation plans for specific SRH interventions will be produced. There will also be strengthening of relevant capacities of stakeholders. Project success will be measured in terms of the extent to which there is a consensus on the set of HIS indicators that are feasible for use in each of the three countries.   The project is of three year duration and will be led by the Social Research Centre (SRC) at the American University in Cairo. It will build on SRC's previous work at the regional level supported by World Health Organization and United Nations Population Fund's regional office.  The project is closely aligned with the Government of Canada's new feminist international assistance policy, the strategic priorities detailed in the 2016-2030 WHO led Global Strategy for Women, Children and Adolescents, and the overarching 2030 global agenda for sustainable development.",0.029842

Readiness to Adopt Food Related Non-Communicable Disease Prevention Policies in Africa. READINESS TO ADOPT FOOD RELATED NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASE PREVENTION POLICIES IN AFRICA. Increasing consumption of unhealthy diets is fuelling the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) across Sub-Saharan Africa. Fiscal and policy interventions for addressing diet-related NCDs such as increased taxation on Sugar Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) have been endorsed by the global health community as being highly cost-effective. There are however significant challenges associated with the adoption and implementation of such interventions due to their inherent nature in politics and the economy. To establish a comprehensive understanding of the political landscape in which policies for NCDs are developed and implemented, this project proposes a landscape analysis in a subset of Eastern (Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya) and Southern African (Botswana, Namibia and Zambia) countries. The aim of the project is to assess the existing and required evidence on the potential benefits of NCD-related fiscal and policy interventions, and an assessment of the challenges for their possible adoption. Understanding the nature of the burden of disease, data constraints, relevant politico-economic factors, key actors and the existing policy environment will help to develop feasible, specific and targeted evidence for the adoption of fiscal and policy interventions that are tailored to the context of each country. The work will be led by researchers at PRICELESS SA (Priority Cost Effective Lessons for System Strengthening South Africa) unit of the School of Public Health, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. They will collaborate with in-country researchers based at economic policy research think-tanks or academic institutions in each of the seven participating countries. The primary desired research outcomes will be; 1) increased understanding of whether diet-related NCD prevention policies would be necessary and suitable; 2) increased understanding of the feasibility of implementing these policies; and country and context specific public health recommendations on fiscal and policy interventions for prevention of diet-related NCD.",0.014238

This project aims to support the Global Financing Facility (GFF), a multi-donor financing platform that provides country-led, sustainable financing to end preventable maternal, newborn, and child deaths. The GFF finances national reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) plans, supports countries in the transition towards sustainable domestic financing of RMNCH, finances the strengthening of civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, finances the development and deployment of global public goods, and contributes to a coordinated financing for RMNCH.Project activities will vary depending on the RMNCH priorities of the recipient government, but may include: (1) Clinical interventions such as increasing access to health services and health facilities from the pre-pregnancy stage onwards for women, newborns and children, (2) Health systems interventions such as strengthening health information systems, increasing access to medical products/technologies, and health systems strengthening; (3) Multi-sectoral interventions such as education, nutrition, and water and sanitation, in addition to strengthening CRVS systems.The GFF supports countries in developing individual RMNCH investment cases to align various sources of financing to national RMNCH priorities. The GFF leverages additional financing for RMNCH by matching grant funding from the GFF Trust Fund to financing from the International Development Association (IDA) and the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). GFF country selection is prioritized on the basis of criteria that includes available resources, need, population and income, eligibility for IDA/IBRD loans and the ability to achieve results. / Ce projet vise à appuyer le Mécanisme de financement mondial (MFM), une plateforme de financement multidonateurs qui fournit des fonds durables gérés par le pays pour mettre fin aux décès évitables de mères, de nouveau-nés et d'enfants.

F.a: Strong unions and QPS in Philippines health sector. F.A: STRONG UNIONS AND QPS IN PHILIPPINES HEALTH SECTOR. The project strengthens health sector trade unions, their joint collaboration and their advocacy in legislative processes and to improve the public health care system in the Philippines. The main objective is the enactment into law of two proposed legislative bills on health: raising of the paid maternity leave to 100 days and expanding the coverage of national health insurance scheme to all Filipinos through Universal Health Care bill. Increasing union membership, training, awareness raising and networking of health workers' organizations contribute to the advocacy work.The Philippine Government continues cutting funds from public health care and weakening the working conditions of public health workers, through privatization of public health services and favouring short-term contracts and contract agency labour. The privatization has already now decreased the health budget which challenges the availability of services and the working conditions of health workers. Even vital health services are being transferred from public management to private enterprises. At the same time health care is no longer free of charge. Close to 10 million Filipinos are not covered by National Health Insurance. Side services such as cleaning, laundry, catering and security are being outsourced which increases the dispersion of workers and thus makes organizing more difficult. Weak and dispersed unions are not capable of efficient interest representation of the workers. As a result, the understanding of the new legislative measures among the health sector unions increases and the political approval and enactment into law of those bills are promoted by advocating political decision-makers. The joint collaboration of the trade unions improves and union membership increases by at least 13 000 new members: 9 new local unions in public health care and 3 new unions in private health care join the coalition. Also, an increase for public health care budget will be advocated. The beneficiaries are Philippine health sector workers and citizens using the health services.  The project is implemented by Public Services International (PSI) together with its member unions in the Philippines (AFW, CIU, PGEA, PSLINK ja PIPSEA).",0.011642

Programme: Sanger Resource Collaboration. Description: The major cholera outbreaks seen in Africa and Latin America since the 1960 s can be explained by the repeated introduction of a single lineage of epidemic Vibrio cholerae from the Bay of Bengal in South Asia. Members of this lineage circulate across continents and then disappear only to be replaced by clonally related strains emanating from the same source. Whilst this means the prevailing &lsquo;Cholera paradigm theory linking infection by Vibrio cholerae to local environmental sources, does not apply to most cholera endemic regions, it appears to apply in South Asia. Our team combines expertise in cholera biology and ecology, microbiology and genomics. Our aims are closely align to the WHO initiative Ending cholera 2030 attempting to reduce cholera deaths by 90%. Hypothesis: The environmental Vibrio cholerae population in the Bay of Bengal supports the emergence of pandemic cholera. Aim 1: Generate a long term genomic view of environmental V. cholerae in Bangladesh from live archived samples to understand their evolutionary dynamics and their relationship to 7PET epidemic V. cholerae . Aim 2: Link genome evolution of V. cholerae to environmental conditions and flux.",0.108474

If this pilot system is successful, we will be able to expand the scope of this initiative to support systemic policy engagement across the breadth of all our work. There are three components to the proposed project: Component one: Strengthening our understanding of how policy engagement operates in Vietnam and within OUCRU. This includes an external policy-mapping project, and an internal policy engagement review. Component two: Implementing a pilot programme of systemic policy engagement. In this component we will develop a policy engagement plan and establish a Policy Stakeholder Advisory Board (PSAB) to create opportunities for continuous stakeholder engagement beyond the life of this project. Component three: Monitoring and evaluation . In this component we will develop a theory of change, and we will conduct evaluations of the policy engagement plan, and of the PSAB in line with that theory of change to inform the next steps.",0.089501

Description: I will conduct a comparative analysis of the regulation on data sharing and biobanking in selected countries (USA, United Kingdom, Dominican Republic) considering the Guidelines 11 and 12 of the International Ethical Guidelines for Health-related research in humans to inform Dominican public health authorities regarding the need to review and consider the broadening of the aspects that should be subject of the local regulation. Regulatory documentation of the selected countries will be identified from the International Compilation of Human Research Standards 2018 Edition Compiled By: Office for Human Research Protections U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The eco-epidemiology of leptospirosis in South Africa and Madagascar. THE ECO-EPIDEMIOLOGY OF LEPTOSPIROSIS IN SOUTH AFRICA AND MADAGASCAR. Programme: Clinical Research Career Development Fellowship. Description: In a changing world, zoonotic pathogens are an increasing risk to human health. Leptospirosis is a widespread and common zoonotic disease with the greatest burden of disease falling on the poorest communities in the developing world. Leptospirosis is increasingly being recognised as a public health threat in South Africa and Madagascar and an urgent need has been identified to establish which Leptospira strains are responsible for human infections and what their key reservoir hosts are. Leptospira are notoriously challenging and time consuming organisms to culture. Therefore, using recent advances in DNA capture and enrichment technologies, I aim to identify evidence of transmission between reservoir hosts and humans by generating culture-independent high resolution molecular typing data directly from human and reservoir host samples. These data will be used to refine diagnostic antigen panels, identify the animal sources of human infection and inform control programs. Increasing the Leptospira genomic resources from sub-Saharan Africa will also allow me to explore fundamental questions related to the microevolutionary changes required for cross-species transmission of zoonotic pathogens and the role of horizontal genetic transfer in the evolution of bacteria in a real world system.",0.196415

Characterisation of the duocarmycin natural product family for novel antitumor agents. CHARACTERISATION OF THE DUOCARMYCIN NATURAL PRODUCT FAMILY FOR NOVEL ANTITUMOR AGENTS. Programme: Seed Award in Science. Description: As a general focus, the Moore lab aims is to understand the biochemistry that underpins how we can make natural products for drug development purposes using enzymatic approaches. In particular, the duocarmycins have shown potential in pre-clinical and phase I clinical trials. This project will address a fundamental gap in our understanding of how the natural product duocarmycin is made in Streptomyces bacteria, beginning with its genetic characterisation. This project will provide the following deliverable goals, which are achievable by a technician entry scientist and provide a strong foundation for future studies in duocarmycin biosynthesis, as well as providing links to pursue broader implications of this important natural product family. Goal 1 - Genetically characterise the Streptomyces corchorusii duocarmycin biosynthetic genes Goal 2 - Develop a purification method and structurally characterise the obtained duocarmycin natural product Goal 3 - Demonstrate pre-clinical trial evidence for tumour cell inhibition In addition, studying duocarmycin biosynthesis is my first project as I start my group. This aligns strongly to my expertise in deciphering natural product biosynthetic pathways (Moore et al , PNAS 2013; Moore et al , Nature, 2017), as well as transitioning my career towards discovering medicinal drugs from natural product sources.",0.125937

The Invention of Vegetarian India: Marathi Dietary Politics,1900-1960. THE INVENTION OF VEGETARIAN INDIA: MARATHI DIETARY POLITICS,1900-1960. Programme: Research Fellowship in H&SS. Description: What made vegetarianism the dominant trope for understanding India s diet, given that the majority of Indians are meat-eaters? I address this puzzle through an investigation of popular literature on diet and nutrition published in India between 1900 and 1960. Given the pre-eminence of Western Indian&mdash;particularly Marathi&mdash;publishing on dietetics, I focus on this region s publications as a case study to gain insight into the rise and consolidation of the idea of India as &lsquo;naturally vegetarian. In particular, I investigate how debates on what constituted a scientific diet for India both informed and were informed by contemporary social and political debates about something apparently unrelated: the Indian caste system. I will ask: to what degree were Indian dietetics re-framing of &lsquo;scientific and &lsquo;natural food practices instrumental in sustaining a caste-based social order? And to what extent did meat, milk, fasting and eating a &lsquo;balanced diet come to function as wider discursive technologies of cultural governance? By situating Marathi dietary modernity within the broader context of the global rise of &lsquo;nutrition , I will explore if, and how, the emergence of nutritionism in India simultaneously made the everyday act of eating into an assertion of social power.",0.196935

Examining the implementation of the Kenya Community Health Strategy in urban informal settlements. EXAMINING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE KENYA COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY IN URBAN INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS. Programme: International Masters Fellowship. Description: The Kenya Community Health Strategy (CHS) is a plan of action to expand community access to health care using - amongst other measures - community health volunteers (CHVs). The CHS has had varying degrees of success with ongoing discussions on how to strengthen it. There is limited information on implementation of the CHS in urban informal settlements (&lsquo;slums ) such as those located in Nairobi, Kenya. This is despite such areas accounting for a high burden of disease. Focusing on four large slums within Nairobi County and utilizing a qualitative exploratory approach, this study seeks to understand what influences the performance of CHVs. Individual and group interviews will be conducted with various cadres of health staff at sub-national and community level. These will be supplemented with observations and document reviews. Data will be analysed using framework analysis. The findings from this work will have direct relevance on ongoing policy discussions and strategies on how to strengthen the role of CHVs to attain universal health coverage (UHC). Findings will also inform potential future intervention studies on the effectiveness of CHVs to support the recovery of ill children post hospital admission.",0.153139

Regional Hub to Provide Scientific and Technical Support on Evidence-Informed Decision-Making on Vaccines in Africa. REGIONAL HUB TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT ON EVIDENCE-INFORMED DECISION-MAKING ON VACCINES IN AFRICA. Programme: Discretionary Award - Vaccines. Description: Optimal healthcare decision making must be premised on high quality and timely evidence. Decision making on immunisation is increasingly becoming complex and challenging as the scope and costs of new vaccines increase, as well as changing epidemiology of vaccine preventable diseases. Therefore at a country level, the Ministry of Health (MoH) should have access to evidence-based recommendations from experts in public health, medicine, and vaccinology. Within countries in WHO s AFRO region, this is most commonly facilitated through National Immunisation Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs). Issuance of high-quality evidence-based immunisation recommendations by NITAGs demands competency in scientific skills. Many NITAGs, particularly in low resourced settings, lack optimal scientific skills to issue high-quality and timely evidence-based immunisation recommendations. Sustainable mechanisms to support such technical healthcare groups with essential scientific skills are lacking. There is need to provide a sustainable scientific support to NITAGs and other healthcare groups that routinely access, synthesize and utilize research evidence for policy formulation. We propose establishment of an academic-based Regional Scientific Hub (RSH) to provide sustainable scientific support to NITAGs and other similar healthcare technical groups. This application proposes to conduct a 4 months scoping exercise to inform the establishment of a RSH for the WHO-Africa (WHO-AFRO) region.",0.228873

Description: Mesh Community Engagement Network (<u>www.mesh-ce.org</u>) is a collaborative open-access webspace and networking project for people involved in community engagement with global health research (CE). Building on a successful pilot, we propose a new three-year strategic approach with a focus on measuring impact, using a Theory of Change to provide clarity on how we expect to make a difference to global health by supporting better research. We have three aims: To ensure the value of CE is recognised by a diversity of global health stakeholders and is considered an integral part of research; to generate and strengthen leadership and capacity; and to increase outcomes-focussed, innovative CE. Mesh s vision for the future is that all global health research incorporates high-quality CE built on evidence, good practice and strong networks. Capitalising on the project s impressive reach, geographical spread and high-level partnerships, we will secure a small team and move management from Wellcome to embed the project at The Global Health Network. A robust monitoring and evaluation plan will allow for greater agility and adjustments to the strategy and project delivery, increasing efficiency and leading to the development of Mesh as a low-cost and high-impact project in the future.

Establishing the African Population History Network. ESTABLISHING THE AFRICAN POPULATION HISTORY NETWORK. Programme: Small grant in H&SS. Description: There is a resurgence of interest in African population history. The past 2 years have seen the start of several large projects, PhDs and development of undergraduate curricula on the subject, and the field has been strengthened by the development of new technologies for extracting, linking and showcasing historical population microdata. This is important for African history as population change is a critical indicator of wider historical forces; it is also vital for understanding contemporary demographic regimes and influencing future population growth in Africa. With this grant, I aim to foster collaboration and communication between scholars working in the field of African population history through establishing the African Population History Network (APHN). I aim to raise the profile of African population history through two international workshops. The first will enable scholars to showcase new work and data and will lead to the publication of an edited volume. The second will focus on future comparative projects and will lead to a collaborative grant application. I establish a web presence and newsletter for the APHN to facilitate ongoing communication about members activities and seek funding to sustain the network in the future.",0.028047

Structural basis of use of ion flow across the bacterial inner membrane to power secretion and motility. STRUCTURAL BASIS OF USE OF ION FLOW ACROSS THE BACTERIAL INNER MEMBRANE TO POWER SECRETION AND MOTILITY. Programme: Investigator Award in Science. Description: Bacteria need to control import/export of charged molecules across their relatively impermeable membrane(s) which also house many nano-machines critical for motility and hence infection. These processes are often driven by harvesting the energy stored in ion gradients across the inner-membrane by ion flow through inner-membrane resident channels. Unpublished work from my group has demonstrated that bacterial inner-membrane ion channels which couple ion flow to protein secretion, nutrient import and bacterial motility unexpectedly share a common architecture within their membrane domains. The architecture revealed unexpectedly suggests rotation between components may be mechanistically important and this application seeks to test this hypothesis. The question will be assessed by a series of structural and mechanistic studies that will seek to determine what commonalities in mechanism underlie this shared architecture and how this is adapted to perform the very different biologies achieved. Specifically, what adaptations allow coupling of uni-directional ion flow to achieve work on both sides of the inner-membrane. Using structural and functional tools developed in my group we will study the ion channels in more native contexts both in terms of the membrane bilayer and in terms of the protein interactions that couple ion flow to work to tease out molecular mechanisms.",2.917847

Vaccine-avertable antimicrobial prescribing from influenza and RSV: a mixed-methods observational study. VACCINE-AVERTABLE ANTIMICROBIAL PRESCRIBING FROM INFLUENZA AND RSV: A MIXED-METHODS OBSERVATIONAL STUDY. Programme: Impact of vaccines on antimicrobial resistance. Description: Vaccines against viruses can reduce antibiotic prescribing by reducing the incidence of viral infections that are inappropriately treated with antibiotics, as well as by reducing the incidence of secondary bacterial infections caused by viral infections. We will estimate the magnitude of this effect for influenza vaccination and the potential magnitude for Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) vaccination and enhanced influenza vaccination. First, we willestimate the antimicrobial prescribing attributable to RSV and influenza in the Kaiser Permanente population in Northern California, USA, in total and by drug class and age group. Next, we will estimate the antimicrobial prescribing currently averted by influenza vaccination by comparing antimicrobial prescribing in (1) persons who have not received influenza vaccine vs. (2) persons who have, controlling for age and location within northern California, in aggregate and stratified by age and antimicrobial class. Using these results, we will estimate the number and proportion of antimicrobial prescriptions that may potentially be averted by improved influenza vaccines and (separately) by RSV vaccines that are now investigational, assuming various possible levels of coverage and effectiveness. Notable features of our analysis will be extensive measures to avoid confounding and an examination of waning of influenza prescribing effects with time since vaccination.",0.547813

Promoting sexual and reproductive health rights and a environment sanitation model in Nicaragua. PROMOTING SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RIGHTS AND A ENVIRONMENT SANITATION MODEL IN NICARAGUA. La propuesta se centra en ampliar la cobertura y mejorar la calidad de la atención primaria, en especial de la salud materna, infantil, sexual y reproductiva, y el saneamiento ambiental y el acceso al agua potable en 20 comunidades del municipio de Rosita, en la RACCN.Enmarcada en una estrategia de mayor alcance y magnitud completamente alineada con el Modelo de Atención en Salud Intercultural (MASI RACCN) y el resto de políticas de salud pública, parte de un enfoque de derechos concretado en el fortalecimiento de las capacidades asistenciales, organizativas y técnicas de las redes institucional y comunitaria y de la articulación y complementariedad entre ambas.La población titular de derechos participante asciende a 6.025 personas (3.133 mujeres), que mejorarán su acceso a servicios de salud, visibilización de demandas y participación en espacios de concertación.Indirectamente, el proyecto beneficiará a 6.336 habitantes del resto de las comunidades del municipio de referencia (3.213 mujeres).Para lograr los resultados de desarrollo esperados, se establece una lógica de intervención con 3 componentes fundamentales. En el R1, las redes institucional y comunitaria mejorarán la calidad, pertinencia y equidad de la atención en salud sexual y reproductiva prestada conjuntamente por los titulares de derechosy obligaciones. El R2 aumentará las capacidades de organización, planificación y gestión complementaria de ambos titulares para la promoción de la salud sexual y reproductiva. El R3 desarrollará las capacidades colectivas de los titulares de derechos para garantizar el derecho al agua, higiene y saneamiento ambientalsostenible.De esta forma, se pretende reducir las elevadas tasas de mortalidad materna e infantil por causas prevenibles y evitables, en un contexto que, en la práctica, tolera la vulneración de los derechos de mujeres y niñas, al imponerles un sistema patriarcal asimétrico y una realidad de pobreza extrema, frágil gobernabilidad, ineficiente gestión de recursos públicos insuficientes y marginación y exclusión por razones étnicas yculturales.",0

URGENT PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO DISPLACED WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN YEMEN. URGENT PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE TO DISPLACED WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN YEMEN. La intervención tiene lugar en un contexto de una de las peores crisis humanitarias de nuestro tiempo a causa del conflicto bélico existente en Yemen desde hace cinco años, que ha provocado enormes necesidades humanitarias. La principal víctima de la guerra en Yemen está siendo la población civil. El aumento de la violencia ha perturbado millones de vidas, generando una gran cantidad de víctimas y desplazamientos masivos en la región. Más de 3,6 millones de personas están desplazadas internamente desde que estalló la crisis. Las necesidades humanitarias en todo Yemen siguen aumentando, impulsadas por un conflicto en curso que ha colapsado la economía, los servicios sociales paralizados y los medios de subsistencia gravemente perturbados. Al entrar en el quinto año de conflicto, la crisis humanitaria en Yemen está considerada como la peor del mundo, con un porcentaje de personas que se enfrentan a la muerte, el hambre y la enfermedad mayor que en cualquier otro país. El 80% de la población necesita algún tipo de asistencia y protección; 20 millones de personas padecen inseguridad alimentaria y 14 millones de personas tienen necesidades humanitarias agudas. En 2020, se espera que Yemen siga sufriendo una economía devastada, el continuo desmoronamiento de las instituciones y servicios públicos, el diezmo de los recursos y la falta de instalaciones sanitarias y educativas. Según datos de la OIM, actualmente hay 3,6 millones de desplazados internos (607.865 hogares), así como unos 1,28 millones de desplazados internos que han regresado a sus comunidades de origen (213.427 hogares), dispersos en 22 provincias de Yemen. Con el conflicto en curso y los ataques aéreos que se siguen produciendo, la población total de desplazados internos ha aumentado en un 57% (2 millones de desplazados internos más respecto al año anterior).  Es poco probable que las cifras disminuyan en 2020. Las cinco gobernaciones de Al-Hudaydah, Amanat Al Asimah, Hayya, Taiz y Saada acogen a más de la mitad de los 3,6 millones de desplazados internos. Alrededor del 63% de los desplazados internos (o 2,2 millones) proceden de las mismas cinco gobernaciones. La gobernación de Marib tiene la mayor población de desplazados internos, con 770.028 personas (128.338 hogares). Los siguientes lugares con mayor población de desplazados internos son Sads Ahdak, en la gobernación de Amanat Al Asimah, con 57.444 personas (9.574 hogares), y la ciudad de Amran, en la gobernación de Amran, con 53.226 personas (8.871 hogares).Al mismo tiempo, según los últimos datos registrados, Yemen acoge a unos 265.440 refugiados y 9.746 solicitantes de asilo, de los cuales unos 150.000 no están registrados. La mayoría de los 9.746 solicitantes de asilo registrados a 30 de abril de 2019 son etíopes, seguidos de sirios, iraquíes, palestinos, somalíes y sudaneses.

La propuesta es una prioridad tanto para la Delegación Provincial de Salud de Chefchaouen como para la Asociación de Desarrollo Local-Al Maghrib (ADL-Al Maghrib) (en adelante ADL) y Prodiversa-Progreso y Diversidad. En la Comuna Urbana de Chefchaouen existen 4 Centros de Salud Urbanos (CSU) y un centro de referencia de Nivel 1, los cuales deben asegurar el seguimiento de la salud de la madre y del niño/a, así como el seguimiento de la salud de los/as jóvenes, incluida la salud escolar.  No obstante, las precarias condiciones, la falta de equipamiento en 3 CSU y centro de referencia y la carencia de material didáctico impiden que se puedan prestar estos servicios. Las mujeres no pueden realizar el correcto seguimiento de su embarazo ni tener acceso a servicios de salud sexual y reproductiva adecuados, como el servicio de Planificación Familiar (PF) y de información materno-infantil Clase de Madres (CDM).  El objetivo general del proyecto es Contribuir a promover el Derecho Humano a la Salud en el Norte de Marruecos. Para lograr su objetivo específico Mejorar las condiciones sanitarias promoviendo la salud sexual y reproductiva en Chefchaouen se prevén los siguientes resultados:  El Resultado 1 busca mejorar el acceso a servicios de salud reproductiva a través de la rehabilitación y/o equipamiento de 3 CSU y centro de referencia. Se proyecta fortalecer las capacidades de la Delegación de Salud a través de la mejora integral de estos centros mediante:  - La dotación del equipamiento obstétrico y neonatal para el seguimiento del embarazo y del recién nacido/a.  - La rehabilitación en el CSU El Haouta de las salas dedicadas a los servicios de PF y CDM.  - La dotación del equipamiento adecuado para los servicios de PF y CDM.  El Resultado R2 pretende fortalecer a la administración, como titular de obligaciones, para la eliminación de la discriminación basada en el género que sufren las mujeres y niñas dentro del propio ámbito sanitario. Para ello, proponemos:  - Realizar una serie de capacitaciones en materia de Género e Igualdad y sus implicaciones en el ámbito sanitario y sobre técnicas de detección y actuación en casos de violencia machista.  - Crear materiales didácticos para las campañas de sensibilización y la ¿Clase de Madres¿ que transmitan mensajes no machistas (estereotipos, lenguaje inclusivo, visibilización de la desigualdad de género, etc.) dotando a la Delegación de herramientas que luchen contra la discriminación basada en el género.

From awareness to care: women protagonists of the right to health in Bosnia and Herzegovina. FROM AWARENESS TO CARE: WOMEN PROTAGONISTS OF THE RIGHT TO HEALTH IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA. The aim of the initiative is to allow the treatment of female cancer diseases in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the incidence and mortality rates of these tumors are up to three times higher than those of European countries, although there are on-site treatment capacities. In fact, the pathologies are often found at an advanced stage, so that their treatment cannot be resolutive and non-invasive.As shown by many good practices in Europe and in Italy, the ability to care must be combined with a culture of health and prevention that leads the population towards the awareness of the need to carry out routine checks before the diseases occur, as part of health, well-being and life care. The spread of this culture allows to save many lives and treat diseases diagnosed in non-advanced phases better and in a less invasive way. This is why this initiative crosses female empowerment with health. There can be no effective treatment without a stronger women awareness about the acts necessary to preserve their own health and, with it, all their rights. This proposal come from the effective and historic collaboration between the Piedmont Region and the Canton of Zenica/Doboj in Bosnia which, in collaboration with RE.TE, have allowed to develop on site the ability to treat cancer diseases, bringing not only the resources for the preparation and allocation of the departments, but also to conduct a personnel training in Italy and on site. After years of fruitful collaboration in terms of results and relationships, the meaning of this proposal lies in the implementation of an intervention that allows to enhance what has been achieved so far, working to locally grow the culture of prevention (sensitization, dissemination, information to the population) and that the care chain of Bosnian women by the local health institutions reflects European quality standards.  To do this, it is necessary to work with local associations centered in women's rights so that they become, as in our country, vehicles and sentinels of the right to health and prevention. Together with them, an information campaign will be prepared and implemented according to the standards of Italian and European organizations, that have been involved for years in the involvement of women for the right to treatment, well-being and prevention of specifically female diseases. The action plans to involve the Federal level of Bosnia and Herzegovina, because all the cancer treatment centers of the Federation can share and standardize their level of prevention and care in their territories of reference. The prevention campaign will be made available to all these centers, as well as training in breast cancer screening programs. The Federal Ministry of Health has already expressed its intention and willingness to participate in work and to spread uniform standards in this field throughout the territory. A pilot breast cancer screening project will be conducted in the canton of Zenica/Doboj to serve as a case stud",0.110048

After more than 10 years, the decentralization process is still a work in progress. The local governments ability to mobilize citizen participation and support local development has been constrained by a variety of factors including: poor representation of women and indigenous leaders in municipal government and in local development councils; lack of skills and experience in conducting public communication; and lack of effective accounting systems to build public trust. In response, the Guatemala Local Governance Project, supported under a task order from the USAID SUM II IQC and with funds from Feed the Future (FtF), is working in the East of Guatemala (Corredor Seco Region) and the Western Highlands of Guatemala to assist 25 rural municipalities to increase its capacity of municipal governments to respond to the needs and demands of their constituents, institutionalize participatory processes and transparency through the promotion of informed citizen participation (particularly of women, the indigenous, and other traditionally under-represented groups) and promote local economic development.",0.318467
